Usage
=====

  You can mount procfs as:

  $ sudo mkdir /proc
  $ sudo chown root:admin /proc
  $ sudo ./procfs /proc -f

  For certain things to work (and not crash procfs), you must either run
  procfs foregrounded (through the -f option), or use the procfs.plist
  file to run procfs through launchd.
