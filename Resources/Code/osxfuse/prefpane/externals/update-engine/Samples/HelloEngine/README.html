<h1>Welcome to HelloEngine</h1>

Welcome to HelloEngine, a minimal, but functional, Update Engine
program.  <tt>HelloEngine.m</tt> has some comments about how Update
Engine works.  This file has instructions on how to run the sample,
and to get your own Stuff into Update Engine's pipeline.

<p>

Here's how to run things:
<ul>
  <li> Copy <tt>Samples/HelloEngine/TestApp.dmg</tt> to <tt>/tmp</tt>
  <li> Copy <tt>Samples/HelloEngine/ServerResponse.plist</tt> to <tt>/tmp</tt>
  <li> Build HelloEngine
  <li> Run HelloEngine:<br>
<pre>HelloEngine -productID com.google.HelloEngineTest -version 1.2 -serverURL file:///tmp/ServerResponse.plist</pre>
  <li> Note new file, <tt>/tmp/HiEngine.sh</tt>, which has been "updated".
Run that for a little message of greetings.
<pre>

</pre>
</ul>

<p>

You'll see a lot of output.  This is Update Engine letting you know
what's going on, and can be useful when debugging things.  It also
looks cool.

<p>

The very last line of the output will look something like:
<pre>
2008-09-12 11:51:01.933 HelloEngine[7055/0x0b0e] [lvl=2] main Update Succeeded
</pre>

<p>


The last word from HelloEngine will be "Succeeded" or "Failed".  If it
Succeeded, try running <tt>/tmp/HiEngine.sh</tt>



<h1>Getting HelloEngine to run your own stuff</h1>

There are a couple of steps to get HelloEngine to run your stuff:
<ul>
  <li> Edit the <tt>.engine_install</tt> script
  <li> Build your disk image
  <li> Calculate hash and file size
  <li> Edit your <tt>ServerResponse.plist</tt>
</ul>


<h2>.engine_install</h2>

First you'll need to edit the install script, which you can find at
<tt>Samples/HelloEngine/TestAppDMGSource/.engine_install</tt>.  This script
is what does the heavy lifting of updating your product.

<p>

<tt>.engine_install</tt> is required for Update Engine to function
properly.  You can also create <tt>.engine_preinstall</tt> and
<tt>.engine_postinstall</tt> scripts to do preflight and postflight
work.  Outside of these scripts, Update Engine doesn't care what you
have on the disk image.

<p>

The standard-out of the preinstall script gets added to the
environment of the install and postinstall scripts under the
environment variable <tt>KS_PREINSTALL_OUT</tt>.  Likewise, the
standard-out of the install script gets added to the environment of
the postinstall script under the environment variable
<tt>KS_INSTALL_OUT</tt>.  This way you can pass information from one
script phase to the next.

<p>

The scripts can be written in any language you want, but you'll want to
stick to the languages (and language versions) that exist on your
user's machines - they probably don't want to download and install the
Object Fortran++ Scripting Bridge so that you can update your
software.  Likewise, if you're using Python, don't use any Python 2.5
features if you intend to update users on Tiger, who only have python 2.3.

<p>

<tt>.engine_install</tt> and the others don't even have to be a
script, they can be compiled C programs if that makes sense for what
you need to do.

<p>

The first argument of the script is the directory to the mount point
of the disk image that Update Engine downloads.  Be aware that this
path can contain spaces, so do whatever string-space-quoting hygiene
is necessary for your language of choice.

<p>

Inside of the script, you're welcome to do whatever you want, assuming
it can be done as the user ID that the HelloEngine tool is run as.  If
you run it as root, then you can do most anything, please don't delete
the user's <tt>/Application</tt> directory.


<h2>Build your Disk Image</h2>

Once you've written your script, you'll need to build your disk image.
The easy way to do this is to drop all your stuff into a directory and
use Disk Utility to create the disk image.  The command to do so is
hidden under <i>File &gt; New &gt; New Disk Image From Folder</i>.
Choose the <tt>TestAppDMGSource</tt> folder, or whatever folder you're using for
your product update, and make sure you're making a compressed,
unencrypted disk image.

<p>

Here's a command for doing the same thing that's easier to put into an
Xcode project:
<pre>
hdiutil create -ov -imagekey zlib-level=9 -fs HFS+ -format UDZO -scrub
-srcfolder $DIR $DISKIMAGENAME
</pre>

<p>

In a real-world application, this can (and should) be the disk image
that you give your users.  This saves you from having to build, test,
and deploy two different payloads for your product.  The reason
the scripts have the leading dot is so that they won't interfere with
the Finder's presentation of the disk image when it's mounted by the user.

<h2>Caculate Hash and File Size</h2>

Once you have the disk image, you'll need to calculate a checksum, and
put the checksum and size into the <tt>ServerResponse.plist</tt> file.

<p>

First, calculate the checksum:
<pre>
$ openssl sha1 -binary TestApp.dmg | openssl base64
</pre>

This will output something like 
<pre>
BnKj+Bpy4KspQ4qzlkRn6EIaJ4g=
</pre>

After you figure out how to pronounce that, you'll need to figure out
how big the file is:

<pre>
$ ls -l TestApp.dmg
-rw-r--r--   1 bork bork  50405 Sep 11 18:29 TestApp.dmg
</pre

So it's 50405 bytes.

<h2>Edit your ServerResponse.plist</h2>

Edit the ServerResponse.plist and plug the values into the Size and
Hash settings:

<pre>
<font color="gray">
...
  &lt;array&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;ProductID&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;com.google.HelloEngineTest&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;Predicate&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;Ticket.version != '2.0'&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;Codebase&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;file:///tmp/TestApp.dmg&lt;/string&gt;
<font color="black">
      &lt;key&gt;Size&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;<b>50405</b>&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;Hash&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;<b>BnKj+Bpy4KspQ4qzlkRn6EIaJ4g=</b>&lt;/string&gt;
</font>
    &lt;/dict&gt;
  &lt;/array&gt;
...
</font>
</pre>

In a real development environment, you'll probably want an Xcode
script build phase to do this automatically for you.

<p>

Now you can use your <tt>ServerResponse.plist</tt> and your
<tt>TestApp.dmg</tt> with HelloEngine to get your stuff run.


<h1>What can go wrong</h1>

There are some moving pieces involved, and some things that might go wrong
as you get things working.  Here are some common ones:

<ul>

 <li> Forgot to replace <tt>/tmp/TestApp.dmg</tt>
 <li> Forgot to copy <tt>ServerResponse.plist</tt> to <tt>/tmp</tt>
 <li> Bad hash or bad size when you change the payload<br>
</ul>

These result in <tt>ServerResponse.plist</tt> having a size and/or hash that's
out of sync with the TestApp.dmg file.  Update Engine will reject any paylod
that doesn't match the size and hash.

<ul>
 <li> Your <tt>.engine_install</tt> is not <tt>+x</tt>
</ul>

Make sure that your .engine_install file has the executable bit, set with
<tt>chmod +x .engine_install</tt>

<ul>
 <li> Making assumptions about the current working directory
</ul>

The current working directory for your script is undefined, and will
probably be the directory where you are running the HelloEngine
command from.  This can confuse your testing if you run HelloEngine
with your current working directory being that of your
TestAppDMGSource directory.  The script will work fine when you run
the install script by hand, but will fail when Update Engine is doing
its thing.

<p>

Make sure you get the path to your mounted disk from the
first argument to the script, and make sure that you account for the
the fact that it might contain spaces.  Even if your disk image name
doesn't contain spaces, the system might mount it at
<tt>"/Volumes/Payload 1"</tt> if <tt>/Volumes/Payload</tt> is already
in use.

</ul>
