 * @framework FUSE for macOS Framework
 * @abstract An Objective-C API for creating user space file systems.
 * @discussion OSXFUSE.framework is an Objective-C API that enables you to
 * easily create a file system in user space. With a little bit
 * of work, FUSE for macOS can be used to display any data set as a file system
 * that can be viewed and manipulated in the Finder.<br>
 *
 *
 * Building a working file system involves creating a class that implements a 
 * subset of the 
 * <a href="GMUserFileSystem_h/Categories/NSObject_GMUserFileSystemOperations_/index.html">
 * GMUserFileSystemOperations</a> informal protocol methods to 
 * serve your file system's data, and using a 
 * <a href="GMUserFileSystem_h/Classes/GMUserFileSystem/index.html">GMUserFileSystem</a>
 * instance to act as the file system's controller.<br>
 *
 *
 * The best way to get started with OSXFUSE.framework is to follow the tutorial,
 * which guides you through creating a simple read-only file system. It is also
 * a good idea to look at some other Objective-C examples, such as HelloFS, 
 * LoopbackFS, and the other example file systems found
 * <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/filesystems/">here</a>.
