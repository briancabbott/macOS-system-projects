Version 1.0.3-1.3.6 (released 05-Nov-2001)

  * fix structure alignment problem which caused crashes in UNLOCK on
    some architectures (Jean-Frederic Clere, Dave Kristol)
  * ignore Depth: Infinity for non-collection resources in a PROPFIND; 
    this prevents a bogus error when someone has not used the
    "DAVDepthInfinity On" directive
  * fix for Web Folders not recognizing the last-modified date in
    PROPFIND responses (Joe Orton)
  * tweak to also allow recognition of the creationdate
  * fix copying of collection properties during a Depth:0 operation
    (Keith Wannamaker)
  * return 507 (Insufficient Space) for quota errors (on Linux, at
    least) (Joe)
  * fix moving/copying of a collection over a non-collection (found by
    Joe's interop testing tool)
  * LOCK with a missing intermediate collection now returns a standard 
    409 (Conflict) response rather than 500 (Internal Server Error)
    (Keith, reported by Dan Brotsky)
  * Windows build updates for more recent Apache layouts (Keith)
  * fix problem with MOVE/COPY to a destination that is a locknull
    resource. (reported by Patrick Collins)
  * fix problems with empty URIs in xmlns attributes (fixes from Joe
    and Greg, reported by Julian Reschke)
  * removed generated files from CVS; added autogen.sh
  * build/config changes: look for shared Expat; AIX build tweaks
    (Joe, Matt Sergeant, Greg)
  * fix moving of a collection over a non-collection (reported by
    Joe's interop tool)

Version 1.0.2-1.3.6 (released 19-Oct-2000)

  * ./configure and build updates:
    - allow building from outside the source directory (Fred Sanchez)
    - proactively detect broken APXS installations (idea from PHP)
  * updated INSTALL doc to document broken APXS installs and with more
    information about the Last-Modified header problem
  * minor changes to dav_dyn to make it easier for third parties to
    add backend modules
  * the DAV directive now takes a provider name (e.g. DAV svn). DAV On
    enables the default provider.
  * DAV Off is no longer allowed *under* a DAV On directive -- once a
    parent location/dir defines a DAV provider, then that provider
    handles everything under it.
    [ this is a possible backwards-compat issue for httpd.conf ]
  * add some slack time for expiring locks: we report an expriation of 
    N seconds, but the timeout doesn't occur until N + 120
    seconds. this helps out Office which sends its Refresh too close
    to the expiration time, and can then miss due to latency
  * fix handling of the If-Unmodified-Since header by updating the
    request_rec's mtime field. (Joe Orton)
  * partial fix for filesystems that can have file sizes more than
    4G. small files are reported properly; large files could still be
    reported incorrectly. (Annette DeSchon)
  * maintain the executable property across COPY and MOVE (Joe Orton)
  * update opaquelock functionality and Expat parsing for proper
    operation in EBCDIC environments (Jean-Frederic Clere)
  * fix leak of subrequests in property handling (Joe Orton)
  * put real status text into our Multistatus responses
  * fix for operation in an IPv6-enabled Apache (Rolf Haberrecker)
  * if a lock fails due to authentication problems, return a 403
    (Forbidden) rather than 401 (Unauthorized). this fixes an HTTP
    conformance issue where we returned 401 but no WWW-Authenticate
    response header. (Joe Orton)
  * return 413 (Request Entity Too Large) when the XML request body
    exceeds the limit, rather than 400 (Bad Request). (Joe Orton)
  * fix byterange handling for custom repositories (Joe Orton)
  * fix lock inheritance on the destination of a COPY/MOVE (Joe Orton)

Version 1.0.1-1.3.6 (released 28-Jun-2000)

  * fix binary file corruption on Win32 (from Barry Pederson)
  * small tweak in dav_fs_repos.c to aid AIX compilation (via xlc)

Version 1.0.0-1.3.6 (released 13-Jun-2000)

  * new directives:
    - DAVDepthInfinity (from Joe Orton) to control whether PROPFIND
      with a Depth: infinity is allowed.
    - LimitXMLRequestBody to control the size of XML request bodies
      (for PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK)
  * implement Content-Range support for the GET and PUT methods
  * locks record the authenticated principal (from Keith Wannamaker) 
  * fix errors in dav_dyn which prevented proper operation when
    mod_dav is statically linked.
  * fix another tweaky error related to startup initialization which
    ended up causing MOVE/COPY to non-DAV directories to act funny
  * filenames are now case-preserved on a PUT (from Keith Wannamaker)
  * fix bug with timing-out indirect locks
  * Win32 no longer defines the "executable" property
  * fix up error handling in MOVE/COPY/DELETE
  * fixes for "insufficient storage" errors (from Joe Orton)
  * fix UNLOCK for locknull resources
  * disable writing to DAV:getcontenttype and DAV:getcontentlanguage
    (to be fixed in a future version)
  * update prop handling to deal with multiple liveprop providers
  * delay creation of the propdb until a dead prop is truly
    stored. this prevents the creation of a propdb when the client is
    merely setting the "executable" flag.
  * fix crasher when validating the root of a DAV tree (from Joe)
  * properly deal with HEAD requests when we have a custom repository
  * internal cleanups: lint, error propagation, depend on dav_error
    logging rather than direct logging

Version 0.9.17-1.3.6 (released 21-Apr-2000)

  * fix the search for Expat in the Debian builds
  * ton of internal work to truly support liveprop providers
    - more (dynamic) module support
    - revised liveprop provider API
    - dav_props has cleaner logic for live vs dead props, and core vs
      provider-specified props
    - hook contexts and xml_elems now have an ns_map for liveprop use
      (xml_elem lost 'annotation' and gained a couple others, too)
    - mod_dav records a list of liveprop providers, rather than one
    - liveprop providers participate in PROPPATCH via patch_* hooks
    - DAV: header now returns URIs for sets of live properties
      (dav_fs_repos returns <http://apache.org/dav/propset/fs/1>)
  * add the ("http://apache.org/dav/props/", "executable") property to
    control the execute permission flag on the files in the repository
  * flesh out some of the module support, primarily for liveprop
    provider support
  * dav_insert_ns() is broken out from dav_xmlparse.c for reuse
  * lock providers: dav_get_lock_database() is now dav_get_lockdb_path()
  * URIs for a dav_resource are now directly accessible; the get_uri
    hook function is toast
  * use the correct URI in error responses
  * repository API: getetag was moved here from the liveprop API;
    added the dav_stream concept and associated APIs; removed the old
    APIs dealing with FILE*; added set_headers function
  * adding some missing lockdb closes in some error cases
  * better error responses by setting "verbose-error-to"
  * locknull resources no longer define many live properties
  * POST no longer validates against the parent resource
  * added the repository hooks pointer into dav_resource. use this
    value to ensure that a MOVE/COPY operates within the same
    repository.
  * COPY of Depth:0 now works correctly (slight repository API change)
  * fix PROPFIND on the DAV:lockdiscovery property when no locks exist
  * better error reporting in If: header processing
  * fix If: header processing to look for submitted locktokens
    anywhere in the header, not just on matching state_lists
  * normalize the URIs used in If: header processing. mod_dav is no
    longer sensitive to the presence/absence of trailing slashes
  * more regression tests in util/regress

Version 0.9.16-1.3.6 (released 07-Mar-2000)

  * updated INSTALL document with sections on handling problems
  * some work on the internal APIs to help out people building custom
    modules/providers
  * fixed problem with a PUT into a LOCKed collection
  * better error responses for edge cases on a PUT (Joe Orton)
  * fixed encoding of all values in responses (both XML and URL
    encoding as appropriate)
  * add DAVParam directive for future use by custom modules/providers
  * unused/undeveloped DASL query grammar stuff removed

Version 0.9.15-1.3.6 (released 11-Feb-2000)

  * look for Expat in the right locations on a Debian system
  * fix trailing-slash handling problems with the Request-URI and If:
    headers' tagged-list
  * improve handling of non-existent resources
  * some basic versioning support from John Vasta
  * property values are properly XML-quoted
  * DAV:owner (in a lock) now works properly
  * make some standard properties read-only
  * fixed a hang in the Win32 version due to double-opens of the lock
    database (from Keith Wannamaker)
  * fixed a case where the lock database wasn't closed (Joe Orton)
  * add interoperability code for Netscape's Roaming Profiles
    (untested; based on example patch from Niels Baggesen)
  * fixed bug: DELETE requires locktoken for the parent resource
  * update copyright lines to 2000. update snail mail address.

Version 0.9.14-1.3.6 (released 17-Dec-1999)

  * make the configure process a bit more robust for --with-apache
  * major fixes to locking behavior:
    - locknull resources behave better
    - refreshing works better
    - PUT, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY inherit locks appropriately
    - some fixes to UNLOCK behavior
    - lots of work on the validation: the If: header is now processed
      properly, and LOCK will look for conflicting locks
    - tagged URIs in an If: header now match properly
  * more changes to locking provider API
  * bug #37: locknull files were accidentally labelled as collections
  * PROPPATCH now has full rollback behavior in case of an error
  * PROPPATCH/remove no longer errors if a property is not present
  * DAVMinTimeout is now allowed at the top level, per the documentation
  * some fixes to the .dsp file: link against Apache's Expat, use MT DLLs
  * add new utility for managing locks (from client side): lock.py

Version 0.9.13-1.3.6 (released 19-Nov-1999)

  * revise internal error handling: cleaner, simpler, more info, etc.
    For more detail, review the CVS logs for "dav_error" changes.
  * using the above changes, put more info into the error log and in
    some cases, return more info in the HTTP response.
  * alter internal provider hooks for: locks, repository, db.
  * internal conversion to new dav_lock data structure (not yet
    complete)
  * fixed some problems with inheriting locks upon a PUT or MKCOL
  * repository can signal that it can handle a GET request (John Vasta)
  * fix a crasher in saving locks with no owner
  * internal move/copy code cleaned up (John Vasta)
  * fix DAV:getcontenttype (it always returned the content type for
    the Request-URI rather than the "current" resource)
  * fix entity-tag code: DAV:getetag now returns quoted entity tags
    (per the RFC, an entity-tag is a quoted-string)
  * fix checks for If: header processing. in some cases, locked
    resources were allowed to be changed; in others, changes were
    erroneously prevented.
  * the lock owner is now saved, but problems still exist with its
    handling of XML namespaces and stuff.
  * in some cases, a lockdiscovery provided an absoluteURI; it is now
    a relativeURI (like the other cases where we return URIs)
  * fixed Infinite timeouts on locks (John Vasta)
  * some changes to the lockview utility

Version 0.9.12-1.3.6 (released 15-Oct-1999)

  * Win32 make changes (Keith Wannamaker)
  * lock fixes (Keith Wannamaker)
  * tweaks to play nice with C++
  * remove "getprop" from the vsn hooks (John Vasta)
  * fix HEAD requests for repositories (John Vasta)
  * fix problem when a lock provider is not present (John Vasta)
  * fix CC value in Makefile.in (Fran Taylor)

Version 0.9.11-1.3.6 (released 12-Sep-1999)

  * fix LIBS problem in libdav.module.in
  * wrap mod_dav.h with extern "C"
  * fix bug: r->path_info can sometimes be NULL
  * fix problem with GET being too aggressive (mod_dav should be more
    care in deciding to handle these)
  * implement DAV:getcontenttype and DAV:getcontentlanguage. these are
    also r/w propertie. Currently, they are not returned as headers
    during a GET.
  * revise liveprop handling
  * revise lockdb structure into public/private portion
  * perform std If-* checks during If: and lock validation (Joe Orton)
  * limit scope of the DAV directives (Keith Wannamaker)

Version 0.9.10-1.3.6 (released 04-Sep-1999)

  * Added internal APIs for replaceable subsystems. (John Vasta)
  * Added DAVMinTimeout directive (Keith Wannamaker)
  * ./configure improvements and fixes
  * change building of files in APXS case -- compile "outside" of the
    Apache build system and only use APXS to link. This eliminates the
    sdbm_combined.[ch] thing
  * fix building of libdav.so when inside the Apache tree (add the
    dav_shared_stub.c thing)
  * fix problem in remove_locknull_member() to prevent spamming the
    log with errors about not being able to locate the .locknull file.
  * use lstat() within the directory walking code
  * various locking code fixes (Keith, John, Greg)
  * removed the experimental PHP integration. This will be done using
    the subsystem hook approach instead.

  * fix the Lock-Token header to meet RFC 2518 conformance (Keith/John).
  * Visual Studio files upgraded to VC6 (Keith Wannamaker)

Version 0.9.9-1.3.6 (released 15-Aug-1999)

  * Class 2 DAV functionality (locking) (Keith Wannamaker)
  * switch to the autoconf utilities for configuration (Rasmus
    Lerdorf, Greg)
  * bump propdb version to 4: old prop databases could have invalid
    property values in them (the "no namespace" bug noted below)
  * add util/fixvers tool to force an update of propdbs to V4
  * initial rollback support for PROPPATCH
  * fix the PROPPATCH responses when an error occurs
  * fix an IE5 problem where the Destination: header has an
    unqualified hostname (Keith Wannamaker)
  * fix an XML parsing bug: xmlns="" did not reset the default
    namespace to be "no namespace"
  * fix AIX build (via autoconf magic) (Rasmus Lerdorf)
  * add MS-Author-Via header to OPTIONS response
  * refine the OPTIONS response (Keith Wannamaker, Greg)
  * use Apache 1.3.8's copy of expat
  * fix sdbm_combined generation (Peter Windle)
  * fix PUT handling when an error occurs (Keith Wannamaker)
  * initial sketch of dynamic extension support
  * add support for directly opening *DBM files (rather than requiring
    them to be in the state directory) (Keith Wannamaker)
  * DAV:getetag property support (Keith Wannamaker)
  * If: header processing (Keith Wannamaker)
  * enable Win32 support (Keith Wannamaker, John Vasta)

Version 0.9.8-1.3.6 (released 06-Apr-1999)

  * bump propdb version to 3: old propdb databases could have invalid
    property values in them.
  * fix bad bug in property value namespace handling. The child
    elements of a value were not being remapped from the input
    namespace indices to the propdb indices.
  * some refinements in the MOVE/COPY validation code
  * XML processing fixes:
    - attributes do not use the default namespace. if they do not have
      a prefix, then they have "no namespace"
    - never generate "our" XML using the default namespace. the
      default namespace must be reserved for elements that reside in
      the "no namespace" space (it is illegal to use a prefix to refer
      to the "no namespace" concept)
      Net result: we use xmlns:D="DAV:" now
    - revise code to NOT place an empty URI int the namespace table to
      mean "no namespace". instead, it must be handled with a special
      constant. we already had this: DAV_NS_XML was renamed to
      DAV_NS_NONE. it means "do not prepend a namespace prefix"
    - some simplifications of the parsing code (dav_find_prefix and
      the stuff related to DAV_NS_NONE)
    - looks like properties named xml...:name would have been
      generated improperly in a PROPFIND result (a prefix would have
      been added). now fixed.
  * misc comment fixes/updates
  * fix processing of r->allowed (from Ken Coar)
  * conform to Apache-standard formatting
  * check for leading "xml" in NS prefixes is now case-insignificant

Version 0.9.7-1.3.4 (released 23-Feb-1999)

  * MOVE/COPY Destination now defaults the port number
  * MOVE/COPY will now authorize the Destination
  * improve error handling for dav_delete_propset and
    dav_copymove_propset: return dav_response structures rather than
    directly logging an error. similarly, change the return value for
    dav_copymove_file. added save_errno to dav_response for support.
  * fix cross-device MOVEs
  * added some initial work for the SEARCH method from Matthew Parry:
    some new configuration directives plus empty method handler.
  * small fix for HP/UX -- it does not have run-time aggregate struct
    initialization.
  * shift most STATE directory/file handling under the propdb hooks;
    add general state file handling function: dav_copymove_state()
  * add storage of xml:lang values (and other xml:lang handling)
  * update propdb internal version to V2: language values added
  * add SDBM to the distribution. updated Makefile.tmpl and
    Makefile.apxs files.
  * encapsulate propdb access under a hook (vtable) design
  * move GDBM usage into dav_dbm.c covered by the hooks
  * add SDBM usage into dav_dbm.c
  * removed unnecessary RULE_HIDE from libdav.module

Version 0.9.6-1.3.4 (released 31-Jan-1999)

  * switch to new Apache-style license (see LICENSE.html)
  * remove 1.3.3 compatibility; in other words, require 1.3.4
  * small tweaks to insert a couple newlines into XML response text
  * fix small bug where we erroneously trapped POST requests
  * minor nits in the header comments
  * update copyrights to include 1999

Version 0.9.5-1.3.3 (released 13-Dec-1998)

  * more tweaks to the INSTALL file
  * update Makefile.apxs for more flexibility
  * change mod_dav.[ch] to allow mod_dav to work with Apache 1.3.4-dev
  * update dav_props for versioning
  * initial pass (not yet enabled) at storing xml:lang with properties
  * refine dav_open_propdb(), dav_propdb_error() error handling
  * ignore namespace prefixes beginning with "xml" (reserved for XML).
    These are stored in the propdb unchanged (e.g. they are passed thru)
  * internal propdb refinements w.r.t unknown keys in the db (future-proof)
  * move XML utilities from dav_xmlparse.c to dav_util.c. add new
    dav_empty_elem() function.
  * fix small bug in XML to text translation w.r.t size computation of
    attributes.
  * add xml:lang processing (but not storage yet)
  * default namespaces are properly handled now -- it no longer
    assumes that an empty prefix at the top-level means DAV:
  * "no namespace" is understood and handled properly. the default
    namespace now implies "no namespace" rather than DAV:

Version 0.9.4-1.3.3 (released 07-Dec-1998)

  * fixed slash handling in COPY, MOVE, and MKCOL
  * internal work on namespace handling (preparations to be able to
    handle xml:lang and other "xml" prefixes)
  * internal work to add hooks for external processing
    (from Stig Bakken)
  * updates to INSTALL

Version 0.9.3-1.3.3 (released 02-Dec-1998)

  * setting or deleting a property now returns more complex errors,
    but there is still some "flowing" that must happen.
  * looking up a URI for a COPY/MOVE returns more complex errors:
    - 502 (Bad Gateway) is now returned when appropriate
  * fixed a bunch of error responses to compensate for Apache 1.3.3's
    new error response mechanism (it is harder for us to simply
    override). There is now a dav_error_response() function to return
    an error message similar to Apache's, but with our own custom
    response body.
  * The following response status codes now have a proper body:
    - 201 (Created)
    - 403 (Forbidden)
    - 409 (Conflict)
    - 412 (Precondition Failed)
  * cleaned up some actual error message text.
  * fixed some return values from the handler (we needed to return
    DONE more often).
  * added additional COPY/MOVE check for the case where the
    Destination contains the Source (only had the reverse check in
    before).
  * fixed stupid bug in Overwrite: header handling
  * fixed some response handling of DAV: properties (sometimes the
    "good" values would not be returned)
  * removed the silly newline in the <multistatus> response

Version 0.9.2-1.3.3 (released 16-Nov-1998)

  * fixed URI handling for directories; a double slash would occur when
    the Request-URI as terminated in a slash (which is the "proper" format
    for a collection/directory request anyhow!).
  * fixed the broken PROPFIND <prop> response where: a property was not
    found, and the propdb was not present or the property's namespace was
    not present within the propdb.
  * add character set encoding info to responses
  * add Makefile.apxs to distribution
  * fixed crasher with DAV:resourcetype request

Version 0.9.1-1.3.3 (released 06-Nov-1998)

  * fixed: return live props even when no dead props exist
  * fixed: GET processing within DAV trees (don't handle GETs at all)
  * add INSTALL, mod_dav.module, and expanded README (Rasmus Lerdorf)
  * register the module/version with Apache (Rasmus Lerdorf)
  * update to Apache 1.3.3

Version 0.9.0-1.3.2 (released 05-Nov-1998)

  * Initial release
