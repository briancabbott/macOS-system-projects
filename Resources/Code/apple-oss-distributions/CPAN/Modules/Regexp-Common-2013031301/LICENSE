  The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

    * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
      Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
      created through textual modification.
    * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
      modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of
      the Copyright Holder.
    * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
      copyrights for the package.
    * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
      this Package.
    * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis
      of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
      so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
      Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market
      that must bear the fee.)
    * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
      itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It
      also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
      the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating
how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least
ONE of the following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
    them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
    Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
    major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
    Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
    Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
    organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
    files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
    on where to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
    Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
    non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in
    manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to
    get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may
distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them,
and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The End
Artistic License 2.0

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


      Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The
intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over
the development of that Package while still keeping the Package
available as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a
different licensing arrangement.


      Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
the copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified
Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization,
to others outside of your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does
not mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
configuration files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of
the Source form.


      Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you
do not Distribute the Modified Version.


      Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all
of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your
discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form
of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will
be subject to the Original License.


      Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from
the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any
non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do
at least ONE of the following:

(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent
the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the
Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the
Standard Version.
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
(i) the Original License or
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
Distributor Fees are allowed.
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
Versions without the Source

(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid
at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time
while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must
provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you
provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days
after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do
not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
Source of the Modified Version.


      Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the
result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.


      Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms
of this license.


      General Provisions

(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or
distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify,
or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure
that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and
otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims
licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the
Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License
to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT
