This is the Apple fork of the SWIG project. It's been heavily stripped down; most files from the original project are not included.

The original source tarball is preserved at http://src.apple.com/svn/BSD/swig/tags/swig-6/swig-1.3.40.tar.gz

The following files were generated by running configure locally:
  Lib/ocaml/swigp4.ml
  Source/Include/swigconfig.h
