	* lib/lzmaxar.c: if lzma compression is specified but not compiled in, throw an error.
	* src/xar.c: When extracting, save directories until the end.  This lets timestamps get set correctly on directories and addresses issue #58.

	* include/xar.h.in src/xar.c lib/io.c lib/lzmaxar.c lib/bzxar.c lib/archive.c lib/zxar.c: Added an option to pass arguments to the compression code.  This to allow specifying compression levels to gzip, bzip2, and lzma.
	* lib/io.c: Issue 41, fixed a bug where rsize was being used uninitialized.
	* lib/io.c: Issue 42, log a warning and continue if archived-checksum doesn't appear when archiving a file.

	*  test/compression test/data include/config.h.in include/xar.h.in src/xar.1 src/xar.c configure.ac lib/lzmaxar.c lib/lzmaxar.h lib/io.c lib/bzxar.c  lib/Makefile.inc.in lib/zxar.c INSTALL: Incorporate a patch from anders.f.bjorklund for adding lzma compression support.
	2007-10-02 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* include/xar.h.in lib/io.c lib/io.h lib/archive.c: Add a "streaming" API that allows for file data to be extracted incrementally, like the zlib decompression API, instead of requiring the entire file to fit in memory like xar_extract_tobuffer().  This is the inital commit of the API and may still change.  This change is based on a patch from Charles Srstka.

	* lib/io.c: Consolidate the lseek handling code into one function.
		Contributed by Charles Srstka as part of Issue 2.

	* include/xar.h.in src/xar.c src/xar.1 lib/stat.c: Only extract setuid/setgid bits if the user/group are the same as the archived file (if -p/-P are specified on the command line) OR if the newly added --keep-setuid flag is specified.
	* configure.ac lib/stat.c: Fix the autoconf test for ino_t size, and switch the inode and device number printf's to use the autogenerated INO_STRING and DEV_STRING to get the correct formatting parameter.
	2007-09-20 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* src/xar.c src/xar.1: Add -k as a synonym for --keep-existing for tar compatibility.
	2007-09-20 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* src/xar.c src/xar.1: Add --keep-existing flag which prevents existing files from being extracted.
	2007-09-20 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* lib/archive.c: Fix a bug in toc parsing where invalid tocs, particularly with mismatched closing tags, would still be processed.
	2007-09-20 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* lib/filetree.c: Fix a minor memory leak with xar_iter_free() not freeing all memory associated with a xar_iter_t.

	* ChangeLog: renamed from CHANGELOG.
	2007-09-19 Dave Leimbach leimy2k@gmail.com
	* xar/xar.c xar/xar.1: Added support for -j and -z as shortcuts for --compression=bzip2 or --compression=zlib respectively.
	2007-09-19 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* lib/zxar.c lib/bzxar.c: cleanup for more consistency between the two compression modules.  Patch contributed by Anders Björklund from the rpm5 project.
	2007-09-19 Rob Braun bbraun@synack.net
	* CHANGELOG: Added changelog
	* include/xar.h.in src/xar.c lib/util.c: moved helper functions for retrieving and formating file properties such as size, mode, mtime, etc. from src/xar.c to lib/util.c and exported them in xar.h.
	* lib/err.c lib/archive.h: Added the xar_t archive context to the error handler context to be able to retrieve archive level context within an error, such as archive level options, or being able to examine other files than the one the error occurred on.
	* lib/strmode.h lib/util.c config.h.in configure.ac: Import strmode(3) from freebsd to handle the formatting of file mode in xar_get_mode(), used for displaying file mode from xar -tvf.  configure will automatically detect whether to use the OS strmode(3) or the included copy.
