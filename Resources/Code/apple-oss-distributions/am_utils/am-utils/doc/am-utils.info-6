Architecture Sharing
====================

   Often a filesystem will be shared by machines of different
architectures.  Separate trees can be maintained for the executable
images for each architecture, but it may be more convenient to have a
shared tree, with distinct subdirectories.

   A shared tree might have the following structure on the fileserver
(called `fserver' in the example):

     local/tex
     local/tex/fonts
     local/tex/lib
     local/tex/bin
     local/tex/bin/sun3
     local/tex/bin/sun4
     local/tex/bin/hp9000
     ...

   In this example, the subdirectories of `local/tex/bin' should be
hidden when accessed via the automount point (conventionally `/vol').
A mount-map for `/vol' to achieve this would look like:

     /defaults   sublink:=${/key};rhost:=fserver;type:=link
     tex         type:=auto;fs:=${map};pref:=${key}/
     tex/fonts   host!=fserver;type:=nfs;rfs:=/vol/tex \
                 host==fserver;fs:=/usr/local/tex
     tex/lib     host!=fserver;type:=nfs;rfs:=/vol/tex \
                 host==fserver;fs:=/usr/local/tex
     tex/bin     -sublink:=${/key}/${arch} \
                 host!=fserver;type:=nfs;rfs:=/vol/tex \
                 host:=fserver;fs:=/usr/local/tex

   When `/vol/tex/bin' is referenced, the current machine architecture
is automatically appended to the path by the `${sublink}' variable.
This means that users can have `/vol/tex/bin' in their `PATH' without
concern for architecture dependencies.


File: am-utils.info,  Node: Wildcard Names,  Next: rwho servers,  Prev: Architecture Sharing,  Up: Examples

Wildcard Names & Replicated Servers
===================================

   By using the wildcard facility, Amd can "overlay" an existing
directory with additional entries.  The system files are usually
mounted under `/usr'.  If instead, Amd is mounted on `/usr', additional
names can be overlayed to augment or replace names in the "master"
`/usr'.  A map to do this would have the form:

     local  type:=auto;fs:=local-map
     share  type:=auto;fs:=share-map
     *      -type:=nfs;rfs:=/export/exec/${arch};sublink:="${key}" \
             rhost:=fserv1  rhost:=fserv2  rhost:=fserv3

   Note that the assignment to `${sublink}' is surrounded by double
quotes to prevent the incoming key from causing the map to be
misinterpreted.  This map has the effect of directing any access to
`/usr/local' or `/usr/share' to another automount point.

   In this example, it is assumed that the `/usr' files are replicated
on three fileservers: `fserv1', `fserv2' and `fserv3'.  For any
references other than to `local' and `share' one of the servers is used
and a symbolic link to ${autodir}/${rhost}/export/exec/${arch}/whatever
is returned once an appropriate filesystem has been mounted.

`rwho' servers
==============

   The `/usr/spool/rwho' directory is a good candidate for automounting.
For efficiency reasons it is best to capture the rwho data on a small
number of machines and then mount that information onto a large number
of clients.  The data written into the rwho files is byte order
dependent so only servers with the correct byte ordering can be used by
a client:

     /defaults         type:=nfs
     usr/spool/rwho    -byte==little;rfs:=/usr/spool/rwho \
                           rhost:=vaxA  rhost:=vaxB \
                       || -rfs:=/usr/spool/rwho \
                           rhost:=sun4  rhost:=hp300

`/vol'
======

   `/vol' is used as a catch-all for volumes which do not have other
conventional names.

   Below is part of the `/vol' map for the domain `doc.ic.ac.uk'.  The
`r+d' tree is used for new or experimental software that needs to be
available everywhere without installing it on all the fileservers.
Users wishing to try out the new software then simply include
`/vol/r+d/{bin,ucb}' in their path.

   The main tree resides on one host `gould.doc.ic.ac.uk', which has
different `bin', `etc', `lib' and `ucb' sub-directories for each
machine architecture.  For example, `/vol/r+d/bin' for a Sun-4 would be
stored in the sub-directory `bin/sun4' of the filesystem `/usr/r+d'.
When it was accessed a symbolic link pointing to
`/a/gould/usr/r+d/bin/sun4' would be returned.

`/defaults' with selectors
==========================

   It is sometimes useful to have different defaults for a given map.
To achieve this, the `/defaults' entry must be able to process normal
selectors.  This feature is turned on by setting `selectors_in_defaults
= yes' in the `amd.conf' file.  *Note selectors_in_defaults Parameter::.

   In this example, I set different default NFS mount options for hosts
which are running over a slower network link.  By setting a smaller size
for the NFS read and write buffer sizes, you can greatly improve remote
file service performance.

     /defaults \
       wire==slip-net;opts:=rw,intr,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,timeo=20,retrans=10 \
       wire!=slip-net;opts:=rw,intr


File: am-utils.info,  Node: /tftpboot in a chroot-ed environment,  Prev: /defaults with selectors,  Up: Examples

`/tftpboot' in a chroot-ed environment
======================================

   In this complex example, we attempt to run an Amd process _inside_ a
chroot-ed environment.  `tftpd' (Trivial FTP) is used to trivially
retrieve files used to boot X-Terminals, Network Printers, Network
routers, diskless workstations, and other such devices.  For security
reasons, `tftpd' (and also `ftpd') processes are run using the
chroot(2) system call.  This provides an environment for these
processes, where access to any files outside the directory where the
chroot-ed process runs is denied.

   For example, if you start `tftpd' on your system with

     chroot /tftpboot /usr/sbin/tftpd

then the `tftpd' process will not be able to access any files outside
`/tftpboot'.  This ensures that no one can retrieve files such as
`/etc/passwd' and run password crackers on it.

   Since the TFTP service works by broadcast, it is necessary to have at
least one TFTP server running on each subnet.  If you have lots of files
that you need to make available for `tftp', and many subnets, it could
take significant amounts of disk space on each host serving them.

   A solution we implemented at Columbia University was to have every
host run `tftpd', but have those servers retrieve the boot files from
two replicated servers.  Those replicated servers have special
partitions dedicated to the many network boot files.

   We start Amd as follows:

     amd /tftpboot/.amd amd.tftpboot

   That is, Amd is serving the directory `/tftpboot/.amd'.  The `tftp'
server runs inside `/tftpboot' and is chroot-ed in that directory too.
The `amd.tftpboot' map looks like:

     #
     # Amd /tftpboot directory -> host map
     #
     
     /defaults  opts:=nosuid,ro,intr,soft;fs:=/tftpboot/import;type:=nfs
     
     tp         host==lol;rfs:=/n/lol/import/tftpboot;type:=lofs \
                host==ober;rfs:=/n/ober/misc/win/tftpboot;type:=lofs \
                rhost:=ober;rfs:=/n/ober/misc/win/tftpboot \
                rhost:=lol;rfs:=/n/lol/import/tftpboot

   To help understand this example, I list a few of the file entries
that are created inside `/tftpboot':

     $ ls -la /tftpboot
     dr-xr-xr-x   2 root   512 Aug 30 23:11 .amd
     drwxrwsr-x  12 root   512 Aug 30 08:00 import
     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root    33 Feb 27  1997 adminpr.cfg -> ./.amd/tp/hplj/adminpr.cfg
     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root    22 Dec  5  1996 tekxp -> ./.amd/tp/xterms/tekxp
     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     1 Dec  5  1996 tftpboot -> .

   Here is an explanation of each of the entries listed above:

`.amd'
     This is the Amd mount point.  Note that you do not need to run a
     separate Amd process for the TFTP service.  The chroot(2) system
     call only protects against file access, but the same process can
     still serve files and directories inside and outside the chroot-ed
     environment, because Amd itself was not run in chroot-ed mode.

`import'
     This is the mount point where Amd will mount the directories
     containing the boot files.  The map is designed so that remote
     directories will be NFS mounted (even if they are already mounted
     elsewhere), and local directories are loopback mounted (since they
     are not accessible outside the chroot-ed `/tftpboot' directory).

`adminpr.cfg'
`tekxp'
     Two manually created symbolic links to directories _inside_ the
     Amd-managed directory.  The crossing of the component `tp' will
     cause Amd to automount one of the remote replicas.  Once crossed,
     access to files inside proceeds as usual.  The `adminpr.cfg' is a
     configuration file for an HP Laser-Jet 4si printer, and the `tekxp'
     is a directory for Tektronix X-Terminal boot files.

`tftpboot'
     This innocent looking symlink is important.  Usually, when devices
     boot via the TFTP service, they perform the `get file' command to
     retrieve FILE.  However, some devices assume that `tftpd' does not
     run in a chroot-ed environment, but rather "unprotected", and thus
     use a full pathname for files to retrieve, as in `get
     /tftpboot/file'.  This symlink effectively strips out the leading
     `/tftpboot/'.

Log Messages
============

   In the following sections a brief explanation is given of some of the
log messages made by Amd.  Where the message is in `typewriter' font,
it corresponds exactly to the message produced by Amd.  Words in
"italic" are replaced by an appropriate string.  Variables, `${var}',
indicate that the value of the appropriate variable is output.

   Log messages are either sent directly to a file, or logged via the
syslog(3) mechanism.  *Note log_file Parameter::.  In either case,
entries in the file are of the form:
     date-string  hostname amd[pid]  message

File: am-utils.info,  Node: Fatal errors,  Next: Info messages,  Prev: Log Messages,  Up: Log Messages

Fatal errors
------------

   Amd attempts to deal with unusual events.  Whenever it is not
possible to deal with such an error, Amd will log an appropriate
message and, if it cannot possibly continue, will either exit or abort.
These messages are selected by `-x fatal' on the command line.  When
syslog(3) is being used, they are logged with level `LOG_FATAL'.  Even
if Amd continues to operate it is likely to remain in a precarious
state and should be restarted at the earliest opportunity.

Attempting to inherit not-a-filesystem
     The prototype mount point created during a filesystem restart did
     not contain a reference to the restarted filesystem.  This error
     "should never happen".

Can't bind to domain "NIS-domain"
     A specific NIS domain was requested on the command line, but no
     server for that domain is available on the local net.

Can't determine IP address of this host (hostname)
     When Amd starts it determines its own IP address.  If this lookup
     fails then Amd cannot continue.  The hostname it looks up is that
     obtained returned by gethostname(2) system call.

Can't find root file handle for automount point
     Amd creates its own file handles for the automount points.  When it
     mounts itself as a server, it must pass these file handles to the
     local kernel.  If the filehandle is not obtainable the mount point
     is ignored.  This error "should never happen".

Must be root to mount filesystems (euid = euid)
     To prevent embarrassment, Amd makes sure it has appropriate system
     privileges.  This amounts to having an euid of 0.  The check is
     made after argument processing complete to give non-root users a
     chance to access the `-v' option.

No work to do - quitting
     No automount points were given on the command line and so there is
     no work to do.

Out of memory
     While attempting to malloc some memory, the memory space available
     to Amd was exhausted.  This is an unrecoverable error.

Out of memory in realloc
     While attempting to realloc some memory, the memory space
     available to Amd was exhausted.  This is an unrecoverable error.

cannot create rpc/udp service
     Either the NFS or AMQ endpoint could not be created.

gethostname: description
     The gethostname(2) system call failed during startup.

host name is not set
     The gethostname(2) system call returned a zero length host name.
     This can happen if Amd is started in single user mode just after
     booting the system.

ifs_match called!
     An internal error occurred while restarting a pre-mounted
     filesystem.  This error "should never happen".

mount_afs: description
     An error occurred while Amd was mounting itself.

run_rpc failed
     Somehow the main NFS server loop failed.  This error "should never
     happen".

unable to free rpc arguments in amqprog_1
     The incoming arguments to the AMQ server could not be free'ed.

unable to free rpc arguments in nfs_program_1
     The incoming arguments to the NFS server could not be free'ed.

     The AMQ server could not be registered with the local portmapper
     or the internal RPC dispatcher.

   Amd generates information messages to record state changes.  These
messages are selected by `-x info' on the command line.  When syslog(3)
is being used, they are logged with level `LOG_INFO'.

   The messages listed below can be generated and are in a format
suitable for simple statistical analysis.  "mount-info" is the string
that is displayed by "Amq" in its mount information column and placed
in the system mount table.

"${path}" forcibly timed out
     An automount point has been timed out by the Amq command.

"${path}" has timed out
     No access to the automount point has been made within the timeout
     period.

     The mount daemon refused to return a file handle for the requested
     filesystem.

Filehandle error for "${rhost}:${rfs}": description
     The mount daemon gave some other error for the requested
     filesystem.

Finishing with status exit-status
     Amd is about to exit with the given exit status.

Re-synchronizing cache for map ${map}
     The named map has been modified and the internal cache is being
     re-synchronized.

file server ${rhost} is down - timeout of "${path}" ignored
     An automount point has timed out, but the corresponding file
     server is known to be down.  This message is only produced once
     for each mount point for which the server is down.

file server ${rhost} type nfs is down
     An NFS file server that was previously up is now down.

file server ${rhost} type nfs is up
     An NFS file server that was previously down is now up.

file server ${rhost} type nfs starts down
     A new NFS file server has been referenced and is known to be down.

file server ${rhost} type nfs starts up
     A new NFS file server has been referenced and is known to be up.

mount of "${path}" on ${fs} timed out
     Attempts to mount a filesystem for the given automount point have
     failed to complete within 30 seconds.

mount-info mounted fstype ${type} on ${fs}
     A new file system has been mounted.
