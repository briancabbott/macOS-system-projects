Part A:  Installation Notes
===========================

1.  Run the "./configure" script.
2.  Optionally browse and edit Config.h.
3.  Check the Makefile.
4.  "make"

Part B:  Operating System specifics
===================================

The program compiles "out of the box" on many systems thanks to the configure
script, but here are a few notes on some certain systems.

SunOS 4.1.3:  Must use an ANSI compiler like gcc.  You also need the
  System V versions of curses, which are in /usr/5lib, and /usr/5include.
  The configure script should take care of that for you.

HP/UX:  If you have the crap compiler installed, it won't compile because
  it isn't ANSI C.  Use gcc, or get the better compiler.

FreeBSD:  The program won't link with the existing curses library on
  FreeBSD version 1.x.  The configure script tries to detect and tell you
  that, and in fact won't try to use curses if that is the case.  The program
  will link with ncurses, but it doesn't work reliably, and I can't recommend
  ncurses with FreeBSD.

BSDI:  You can't use the existing curses library because it doesn't have
  some needed functions.  You can try ncurses, but I have found that version
  1.9.2 of ncurses and ncftp cause random crashes still.

NeXT:  Even if you get it to compile, it may crash because of what must
  be a NeXT compiler or library bug.  Try using a -posix flag for your
  compiler.  You may not need the -lposix library.

MIPS RC6280 running RISCos 2.1.1AC:  Try using SVR4 source, like:
  setenv CC 'cc -systype svr4'
  ./configure
  make

ncurses:
  This is a freeware curses library with source, by zmbenhal@netcom.com.
  Latest version in: ftp://netcom.com/pub/zm/zmbenhal/ncurses/, or
  at a GNU mirror like ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu.  I will also try
  to keep a recent version of it at the ncftp archive.

SOCKS:
  This is the only (currently) supported way to get ncftp to work through a
  gateway/firewall.  Get it from:
      ftp://ftp.inoc.dl.nec.com/pub/security/socks.cstc/

Questions?

Try sending me mail at mgleason@probe.net.  The latest version of NcFTP
is archived in ftp://ftp.probe.net/pub/ncftp/ .
