2.4.3 :: March 19, 1998

+ Note:  NcFTP will being reborn again someday, as version 3.0.

+ Security problem fixed where a hostile FTP site could create specially
  named files in a subdirectory, and if the directory was "get -R", the
  hostile FTP site could execute arbitrary commands with the client's
  privileges on the client machine.

+ Licensing terms have changed.

+ Changed the probe.net references to NcFTP.com, since probe.net is
  essentially defunct.  I am thankful for Probe's service over the years
  and I am deeply saddened to see them go!

+ Long standing bug fixed where NcFTP would crash if the screen width
  exceeded 160 columns.

+ Fixed a problem where a socket connection could fail because it wasn't
  initialized properly.

+ Cat bug fixed (Thanks, Sander van Malssen).

+ A few other small fixes.

2.4.2 :: October 28, 1996.

+ Daylight savings time bug fixed (Thanks, Chris Hanson).

+ Fixed the spurious character that was appearing in the "User" and
  "Password" prompt.

+ Fixed a broken pipe problem.

+ Throughput results should be more accurate.  Previously they were
  inflated a bit because the stoptime was recorded after the last write
  instead of after the close.

2.4.1 :: October 18, 1996.

+ Bug fixed which cause completion to seg fault.

+ Less lint.

2.4.0 :: October 16, 1996.

+ Block transfer mode added.

+ Fixed a seg fault in RCmd.c.

+ Added fix for Chinese character printing.

+ Added fix for long-lines (Thanks, Kohtala Marko).

2.3.0 :: December 5, 1995.

+ New home FTP site, ftp://ftp.probe.net/pub/ncftp/.

+ New e-mail address, mgleason@probe.net.

+ Now using the "bookmark" paradigm, in place of "recent," "host entry,"
  and "nickname."

+ The "bookmarks" file, formerly "hosts" file, will rename itself to the
  new name automatically and adds another field which denotes whether to
  update the directory path when closing that site.

+ New "bookmarks" commands which replaces the "hosts" command.  New "bookmark"
  command can save a snapshot of the current session at the remote host as
  a placeholder, so you can go back to that location later.  This works just
  like a bookmark does in a Web browser does essentially.  That way a user
  can make a bookmark whenever they want, in addition to the usual automatic
  bookmarks that are saved when you close a newly opened site.

+ Bookmarks added manually by the user will have "noSaveDir" on so the
  directory won't change when you use that book mark but chdir around
  afterward.

+ Added a "cat" command.  This is useful for visual mode, so you can just
  dump a file to the screen and have the auto-pager kick on.

+ Forgot to turn the alarm off when longjmp'ing out.

+ Minor configure script tweaks.

+ Visual mode's history no longer adds blank lines.

+ Minutes remaining in "ETA" can be up to three digits now.

+ Cleanup curses upon a SIGTERM before exiting.

+ Pruned Cpp.c.

2.2.2 :: October 29, 1995.

+ Socks5 support (Thanks to Dave Blob, the author).

+ Using ^Z and then backgrounding ncftp is less likely to abort a transfer
  or cause the process to be stopped because of pending tty output.

+ Interrupting a transfer aborts all of the transfers in a batch instead of
  just the current one.

+ A few fixes for NeXT (Thanks, Vince Demarco).

+ Small bug fixed with forced-reget.

+ Configure script tweaks.

+ Configure script's domain detection from /etc/resolv.conf is better.

+ Another small line-mode prompt bug fixed.

2.2.1 :: October 7, 1995.

+ Really fixed bug where the prompt wasn't updating in line-mode.
  (Thanks, Mark Nordberg)

+ Added "less" as an alias to "page."

+ Small bug in completion code fixed (Thanks, Yakushiji Norihiro).

+ Configure script's /etc/resolv.conf portion now allows ';' as comment
  character.

+ Old versions of readline.h do not prototype filename_completion_function.
  (Thanks, Jody Goldberg).

+ Configure script may work better on SunOS with ncurses.

2.2.0 :: October 1, 1995.

+ Redial mode working again. 

+ Bonus for CHANGELOG readers:  I'm adding Tim MacKenzie's filename
  completion stuff on a test basis.

+ Now refreshing screen after predir.

2.1.1 :: September 16, 1995.

+ Visual mode now displays "RUNNING" in the status bar so you can tell
  when a command is still going.  I'm not sure if I like this yet, so more
  changes may be necessary.

+ Configure script jumps through hoops to find libreadline, for those of
  you who are hellbent on using line-mode.

+ A few small work-arounds for Solaris.

+ The startup-lcwd now expands ~.

+ Using -f flag with csh/tcsh for local globbing  (Thanks, Chien-Ta Lee).

+ Avoiding clearing the screen on exit if an error occurred so you can
  see the error message.

+ Shouldn't crash if the remote server closes connection (Thanks,
  Alexander Komlik).

+ Fixed a condition that could crash the program if a file transfer
  was interrupted (Thanks, Frank Crawford).

+ Forgot <ctype.h> in Main.c (Thanks, David A. Avery).

+ Less lint.

+ The "-C" command line option is now recognized properly.

+ If you're root, we don't write our .ncftp files.

+ Kludge around irix fcntl/NFS bug (Thanks, Victor Boyko).

+ Kludge around ultrix fcntl/NFS bug (Thanks, Chris Metcalf).

2.1.0 :: July 15, 1995.

+ Revamped the curses code in Win.c.

+ Revised the configure.in script to use some of my own m4 macros.

+ Configure script should try the system V directories earlier, so
  the resolv check works correctly.

+ GetHostEntry changed to be more 64-bit friendly (Thanks, Matti Aarnio and
  Murray S. Kucheraw).

+ Lint fixes (Thanks, Thomas E. Dickey).

+ Bug fixed in code that removes "CWD successful" lines (Thanks, Keith Steiger).

+ Remote globbing improved.  This will help fix the problems caused by
  "get -R *".

+ You can once again use "cd <wildcard>" and it should actually work now :-)

+ New user log file format, which write the URL of files transferred.

2.0.7 :: June 10, 1995.

+ Configure script is now smarter about when it should and should not try
  looking for the resolver library.

+ Visual mode now initializes before connecting to a site if needed, so when
  you open a site from the command line you get to see the startup stuff
  from the remote site.

+ If your URL has a trailing slash, then ncftp knows that you want to run
  it's shell.  After opening that site, it changes the directory to the one
  your URL had.

+ A printf bug with too few parameters fixed (Thanks, Robin Cutshaw).

2.0.6 :: May 28, 1995.

+ Configure script doesn't look for -lresolv.  It seems most people can do
  without it even if they have it.

+ Not auto-saving accounts (nor passwords, but still usernames).

+ Stuff for Newsos from SAKAI Kiyotaka.

+ Fixed bug where it was exiting 0 when colon mode failed (Thanks, L. Senator).

+ Added -C flag to get, force reget, so you can try reget when the program gets
  fooled into thinking you don't need to do it.

+ Divide by zero bug fixed in progress meters.

+ Fixed bug where an open macro wouldn't run from the shell command line.

+ Printing 331 messages for non-anonymous logins.

+ WGets now uses ^K for kill-to-end-of-line (Thanks, ache).

+ Statbar progress meter tweaks.

+ Transfer timeouts turned off, since the only purpose they served is to
  update the progress meters and retry the same block.

+ If I turn timeouts back on, it would be more difficult to timeout, since
  the timeout value grows instead of staying constant.

+ Should be more practical on a slow link, like a PPP or SLIP link.

+ Increasing the Network Timeout in the prefs screen now affects transfers
  like it should have been doing, instead of just the control stream.

+ The current directory is now obtainable under VMS servers (Thanks W. Losh).

+ Domain name guessing a bit better now (Thanks, James Lick).

+ Kludging around OSF/1 shell escape bug in visual mode so people quit
  flooding my mailbox about it at least until we (or DEC) fix it.

2.0.5 :: May 1, 1995.

+ Major change:  Using alarms instead of select/poll on both data and
  control streams.

+ Fixed bug where prompt would be screwy if directory name had weird chars
  (Thanks, Mark Rejhon).

+ The cwd in the status bar will abbreviate as needed.

+ gSprintfBuf only allocated once  (Thanks, Tim MacKenzie).

+ Host editor stat bug fixed (Thanks, Albert Ma).

+ Progress meter ETA's now max out at 99:59.

2.0.4 :: April 18, 1995.

+ More tweaking the configure script with HP-UX.  It should work with
  gcc, the useable cc/c89 and print an error for the useless cc.

+ AIX problem with carriage returns (^M) fixed.  Carriage returns are
  now emulated by the visual code.

+ NcFTP now beeps after a long (15 sec) command completes.

+ You can now do "set help" for a list of things to set manually.
  (Thanks, Marcel Mol.)

+ Username field in hosts file can now be 63 characters, for those who like
  to put "user@machine.name" there for your gateway.

+ Configure script explicitly checks for /usr/ccs/lib.

+ "cd reg*ex" didn't work.  Now the code doesn't pretend to support that
  behavior.  It will take a significant amount code to support that.

+ Directory listing and remote server responses have unprintable characters
  represented by \xxx or ^X as needed.  Trailing spaces on a line are also
  shown by \x where x is a space.

+ The command-line interpreter now lets you key in non-printing characters
  by using the 4-character sequence \xxx or the two character sequence ^X.

+ Not printing a "Broken pipe" error if you end a "more" before reaching EOF.

+ Added a new progress meter, #5, the stat meter.  Inspired by Marcel Mol.

+ Added aliases for "ascii," "binary," "mget," and "mput."

+ Fixed a bug in Strn.c involving the const keyword.

+ Current directory prompt is updated better when you cd . or cd ..  with
  unreadable directories (Thanks, Brian Wellington).

+ Man page has summary of command line flags  (Thanks, Janet Jackson).

+ Main program's usage screen includes flags for open and get.

=============================================================================

2.0.3 :: April 3, 1995.

+ FTP cat/more mode now recognizes correct syntax.

+ Vacillated, using PORT now instead of PASV by default.

+ Added a preference option to set default FTP mode.

+ WGets added ^B/^F as equivalents for left/right arrow (Thx, Klaus Singvogel).

+ Polls try again if they get an interrupted system call.

+ Not polling in DataTransfer on writes unless writing to a socket.

+ Not polling in BufferGets.  I hope this will resolve some of the problems
  a few systems (Linux...) were having with timeouts.

p13 : On NeXT, ncftp crashes trying to allocate memory in InitXferBuffer().

=============================================================================

2.0.2 :: March 19, 1995.

+ Using "real" locking now, so the problems with the "i.am.running" file
  should be over with.

+ configure script now generated from Autoconf 2.2.

+ Prompt now shows path if you do "ncftp -L <site>"  (Thanks, Garner Halloran)

+ Man page is now makewhatis compliant.  (Thanks, Tuomo-Markus Tikkanen)

+ Man page now puts version number in title.  (Thanks, Marty Leisner)

+ Man page now has reference to archive site in title.

+ pdir/pls now function properly under visual mode. (Thanks, ache)

+ WGets recognizes KEY_ENTER as a newline/return key.  Not using it was 
  causing problems on some IRIX machines.  (Thanks, Rob Kooper)

+ Redial-mode now prints status messages before sleeping to avoid looking
  like the program hanged.

+ WGets now recognizes ^P/^N as equivalents to up and down arrow.

+ Should now be able to compile with SYSLOG. (Thanks, Fabrizio Pivari)

+ Fixed problem where password could echo.  (Thanks, Tuomo-Markus Tikkanen)

+ Will now compile under Ultrix;  can't get it to work with curses or
  cursesX however.

+ Fixed the bug where a host dropping a connection core dumped.

+ Configure script looks for socks library now.

+ Better compatibility with NeXT.  Well, should be less compile-time errors
  anyway.

+ Now checking for either curses.h or ncurses.h when using ncurses.

+ Fixed bug in WGets that caused a segfault when the arrow keys were used
  when a command history was not in use.

=============================================================================

2.0.1 :: March 7, 1995.

+ Fixed a silly error that prevented compilation when there was no curses
  library available.

=============================================================================

2.0.0 :: March 5, 1995.

+ No longer beta!

+ Added redir and predir.

+ Can now turn trace on and off from the prefs window.

+ The saved directory paths can how have commas and backslashes in them.

+ You can add -DPLAIN_TEXT_ONLY if you don't want to use bold, reverse, etc.,
  text with curses.

+ You can't edit the host entries while you have a connection open now. 
  (If you edit the entry for the current host, it would be overwritten when
  you closed the host.)
