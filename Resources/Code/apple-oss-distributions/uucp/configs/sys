#
# The "sys" configuration file is used to describe all known sites to the local host.
# This file should be configured to match your own environment.
# A minimal set of examples is provided.
#

#
# For protection a system should force a login name and password.
# Example:
#
call-login uucp_tst
call-password sekret

#
# Paths using a leading ~/ imply the public directory.
# Example: specify the public directory
#
pubdir /var/spool/uucp_pubdir

#
# To configure the directories for sending and receiving files set the following commands:
# local-send, local-receive, remote-send, remote-receive
# These can be space separated lists of directories.
#

#
# Example: allow users on the local host to send any files found below root.
#
local-send /

#
# Example: allows users on the local host to request any files below root from a remote system.
#
remote-send /

#
# Example:  allow users on the local host to receive files into /var/spool/uucp_pubdir
# An administrator must create this as a world-writable directory.
# Beware: Creating world-writable directories will make the local system less secure.
#
local-receive /var/spool/uucp_pubdir 

#
# Example: allow users on the local host to upload files into /var/spool/uucp_pubdir on a remote system.
# An administrator must create this as a world-writable directory on the remote system.
# Beware: Creating world-writable directories will make the remote system less secure.
#
remote-receive /var/spool/uucp_pubdir 

#
# Example: Specify a search path to locate executable commands used by uux.
# This is a whitespace separated list of directories.
#
command-path /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin

#
# Example: List the commands a remote system may execute locally.
#
commands ALL

#
# You must specify a call time.
# Example: Calls may be placed at any time (least restrictive).
#
time any 1

#
# Limit how frequently a system is called.
# Example: specify number of seconds before next retry
# 0 means no limit.
#
success-wait 0

#
# Example:  specify that the system is called using tcp.
# TCP is easier to configure than a modem setup.
#
port type tcp
protocol t

#
# Commands above any system line are defaults for all systems following.
# Example: identify a remote systems. (Multiple system entries are allowed).
# Example: for a "tcp port type" the phone is an IP address.
#
system uucpsys1
phone  uucpsys1.apple.com

system uucpsys2
phone uucpsys2.apple.com
