1                             MNC - Multicast NetCat
                            ------------------------

1. Introduction

mnc is a simple, one-direction-at-a-time, "netcat"-like application using
multicast. The aim is to provide a tool for easy debugging and testing when
setting up a multicast network or host. MNC supports IPv4 and IPv6
any-source-multicast and single-source-multicast, but depending on your
platform some of those features may not be available:
       
       L = Listen (Implies IGMP/MLD mupport)
       S = Send

2. Supported platforms

As of September 2004, mnc has been compiled and tested with Linux 2.6.8
kernels, the BSD KAME stack and Windows XP Profesional. Currently automatic
interface selection does not work on a KAME-based host and you will need to
specify the interface when in listening mode.

3. Installing mnc from source on UNIX:

	./configure ; make ; make install

4. Compiling from source on Windows:

nmc is compilable with free utilities available from Microsoft. You need to
download and install the free (as in beer) MS Visual C++ command-line tools
from:
	
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

and the SDK relevant to your platform from:

	http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/

You can run a Visual C++ command-line session, and use:

	cl /DWINDOWS=1 /TC /c *.c 
	link /fixed /out:mnc.exe *.obj ws2_32.lib

to compile a working mnc.exe. The Windows version of MNC does not yet fully
support IPv6 due to underlying limitation in the Operating System.

5. Reporting problems

Any problems, bugs or suggested features should be mailed to colm
