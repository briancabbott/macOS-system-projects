.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command-line utility for interacting with the
.Xr notifyd 8
notification server.
It may be used to post notifications, detect and report notifications,
and to examine and set the state value associated with a notification key.
.Pp
The following table summarizes the actions that may be performed.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-s key val" -compact -offset indent
.It Fl p Ar key
Post a notification for
.Ar key .
.It Fl w Ar key
Register for
.Ar key
and wait for notifications.
.It Fl Ar # Ar key
Register for
.Ar key
and wait for
.Ar #
(an integer) notifications.
.Li E.g.
.Fl 1 Ar key
waits for a single notification.
.It Fl g Ar key
Get state value for
.Ar key .
.It Fl s Ar key Ar val
Set state value for
.Ar key .
.El
.Pp
When invoked with any combination of
.Fl w
and
.Fl Ar #
actions,
.Nm
registers for notification for the specified key(s).
If any key is given with a
.Fl w
action,
.Nm
runs until interrupted with Control-C.
If all registrations are invoked with
.Fl Ar # ,
the program continues to run until the corresponding number of notifications for each key have been received.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
uses mach port registration for keys given with a
.Fl w
or
.Fl Ar #
option.
The
.Fl f
option causes
.Nm 
to use file descriptor registrations for all keys.
.Pp
When a notification for any key that is being monitored is received,
.Nm
prints the key on a single line on its standard output.
The
.Fl v
(verbose),
.Fl t
(time stamp), 
.Fl T
(microsecond timer)
and
.Fl q
(quiet) flags, if specified, modify the output behavior.
.Pp
The 
.Fl v
flag causes
.Nm
to print both the key and the current state value for that key.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
flag causes
.Nm
to print a time stamp preceding the notification key.
.Pp
The
.Fl T
option prints microsecond timing information as raw seconds with 6 decimal digits.
Microsecond times are printed when a notification is received, and when a notification is posted.
When posting,
.Nm 
collects the time before and after calling
.Fn notify_post .
Note that
.Fl T
overrides
.Fl t .
.Pp
The
.Fl q
flag causes
.Nm
to operate silently.
.Pp
.Nm
processes 
.Fl w ,
.Fl Ar # ,
.Fl p ,
.Fl g ,
and
.Fl s
arguments from left to right.
For example, the following will register for a single notification for the key 
.Dq test.abc
and then post a notification for that key.
.Pp
.Dl notifyutil -1 test.abc -p test.abc
