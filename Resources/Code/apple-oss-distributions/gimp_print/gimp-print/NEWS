Welcome to Gimp-Print 5.0 Beta 2!  Please read these release notes
carefully.

Gimp-Print 5.0.0-beta2 is the second beta prerelease of Gimp-Print
5.0.  It is based on the 4.3 series that has been in development for
over two years, and includes many improvements over the very popular
4.2 series.  This release is not considered to be a fully stable
release (there are still various things in flux, and it has not
undergone the extensive testing that is required to declare a release
stable), but we've been using it and we believe that it will be useful
for many purposes.

Gimp-Print is a suite of printer drivers that may be used with most
common UNIX print spooling systems, including CUPS, lpr, LPRng, or
others.  These drivers provide high quality printing for UNIX
(including Macintosh OS X 10.2 and 10.3) and Linux systems that in
many cases equal or exceed proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in
quality and functionality, and can be used for demanding printing
tasks requiring flexibility and high quality.  This software package
includes the Print plug-in for the GIMP and Ghostscript and CUPS
drivers, as well as Foomatic data.

Gimp-Print currently contains over 200 drivers supporting in excess of
600 printer models.

The Print plug-in for the GIMP requires the GIMP 1.2.3 or above on the
1.2 line, or the GIMP 2.0 or 2.1.  You may need to install packages
named "gimp-devel", "gtk-devel", and "glib-devel" (or similar
equivalents) on many systems.  This plug-in will work with any
printing system, and offers a comprehensive user interface to control
all aspects of the printing process.

The CUPS driver requires CUPS 1.1.15 or higher.  You may need to
install a package named "cups-devel" or similar on many systems.
Please the rest of the release notes, in particular the Exceptions and
Workarounds, for full details on installation, as there is an
important caveat.  CUPS is the printing system used on Macintosh OS X
10.2 and above, and many other systems use it.  The combination of
CUPS and Gimp-Print provides a flexible, general purpose printing
system capable of producing the highest quality output with any of the
printers supported by this package.  We strongly recommend using CUPS
with Gimp-Print as a general-purpose printing solution.

The Ghostscript driver requires GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or higher, ESP
Ghostscript 7.05 or higher, or AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 or higher.  It
uses the IJS package included with these versions of Ghostscript to
create a driver that may be built much more easily than traditional
Ghostscript drivers.  The options for this driver are very complex,
and it is normally used with the Foomatic driver integration system.

Users of Macintosh OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) and 10.3 (Panther) can use this
package, as the printing system is based on CUPS.  For ease of
installation, a pre-built package with installer is normally supplied
a few days after the release of the source package.  We highly
recommend that OS X users use the pre-built package rather than
attempt to build it themselves.

NOTE: This package will not work with any version of OS X 10.0 and
10.1 (such as 10.1.5), as those systems do not use CUPS as their
printing system.  This is NOT going to be fixed; you must upgrade to
at least OS X 10.2 in order to use this package.  The reason why is
that OS X 10.2 and above use CUPS as the basis of the printing system.
OS X 10.0 and 10.1 use a different system that would require a
separate driver, and we do not plan to write that driver.

The README file included with this package provides full instructions
on building and installing Gimp-Print.

These release notes contain the following sections:

1) Changes from 5.0.0-beta1 to 5.0.0-beta2
2) Overall changes from 4.2 to 5.0.
3) List of supported printers
4) Printer-specific notes

================================================================

* Major changes between Gimp-Print 5.0.0 beta 1 and 5.0.0 beta 2:

  1) Color generation has been adjusted to improve tonality.  The
     result should be more definition in the highlights and shadows
     and overall lighter tone without reducing maximum density.

     This has been tested on some Epson printers, but has not been
     comprehensively tested.  Please report any issues you may find.

     Note that this change invalidates any profiles generated for
     earlier versions of Gimp-Print.  It is likely that additional
     changes will be made prior to 5.0 final release.

  2) Printing direct to CD on Epson printers that support it now
     works.  In addition, a choice of center hole size (16 mm or 43
     mm) is now offered.  A fine adjustment is provided to permit
     control over positioning of the image on the CD.  This fine
     adjustment setting is not available in the Foomatic interface at
     present.

     It is likely that this support will be further enhanced prior to
     final release of 5.0.

  3) Additional dye sublimation printers (Canon CP-220 and CP-330,
     Olympus P-200 and P-400) are now supported; the Olympus P-10 is
     now partially supported.

  4) Preliminary support for the Epson Stylus C45, C46, C65, C66, C85,
     C86, CX-6600 and PX-V600.

  5) Additional page sizes are now available for Olympus and related
     photo printers (including certain Canon and Sony dye sublimation
     printers).  In addition, other supported page sizes now work
     correctly on the Canon CP-100.

  6) Ink drop sizes have been retuned for all 2880 DPI capable Epson
     Stylus printers that use 4 pl drops (e. g. Stylus Color 880,
     Stylus Photo 780).  These should give better results at
     resolutions below 2880x720 DPI.  Please let us know if they don't
     on any given printer.

  7) A problem whereby the CUPS driver was linked incorrectly in
     certain configurations is fixed.

  8) The GIMP 2.0 plugin is now installed correctly in the GIMP 2.0
     plugin directory, rather than the GIMP 1.2 directory.

  9) A problem with the GIMP plugin not properly exiting at the
     completion of printing has been fixed.  This was reported on
     FreeBSD 4.10 and is system dependent.  The symptom is that at
     when the print plugin finished its work it would stick around,
     and actual printing would not start until the GIMP itself was
     exited.

  10) The GIMP plugins now use less screen space by scrolling certain
     options.

  11) Black generation has been improved for the Epson Stylus Photo
     R300 and related printers on many older paper types.  In
     particular, more black ink is now being used, which should give
     more solid shadows with less color shift.

  12) A "predithered" color correction mode is now available, in
     conjunction with a "predithered" dither algorithm.  These very
     fast algorithms assume that the data has already been screened,
     and simply perform a threshold with no correction whatsoever.
     This is useful for certain custom applications.

  13) The GIMP 2.0 plugin now uses new curve widgets, replacing the
     GTK+ curve widgets.  These widgets will undergo further
     development, adding new functionality.

  14) A problem with Canon 6-color inkjet printers whereby the
     transition between light and dark inks is fixed.  This problem
     was specific to the 4.3/5.0 code line and was a regression from
     4.2.

  15) A problem with Canon printers in DMT mode whereby vertical lines
     were printed across the page is fixed.  This problem was specific
     to the 4.3/5.0 code line and was a regression from 4.2.

  16) A few problems with the display of the preview window in the GIMP
     plugin (both 1.2 and 2.0) are fixed.

  17) Gimp-Print now compiles correctly on Solaris.

  18) The GIMP 2.0 plugin now handles the version 3 printrc file
     correctly.

  19) The printers.xml file now has a more flexible format that
     permits specifying arbitrary parameters.

  20) A problem trying to print a grayscale file from the GIMP with a
     pre-existing printrc file predating Gimp-Print 5.0 alpha-2 has
     been fixed.  Depending upon the system, the bug could cause data
     corruption, a crash at startup, or erroneous display in the
     preview window.

  21) A problem whereby compiling with --enable-static fails in some
     circumstances has been fixed.

  The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

951558  gimp-print 5.0.0-alpha3, bugs with --enable-static
980678  Canon DMT not correct
981304  gimp2 print plugin installed in wrong directory
981759  5.0.0-beta1 doesn't compile on sparc sunos 5.7
982642  Canon 6200 Photo Ink Problems
1000661 GIMP plugin does not refresh preview correctly in some cases
1001029 Auto orientation not updated in preview (causes jumbling)
1001267 GIMP2 plugin does not handle v3 printrc format
1002380 Printing grayscale image w/old printrc file crashes at start
1003003 CUPS executables linked incorrectly
1013465 QUALITY - highlights and shadows blown out
1013470 QUALITY - ESP R300 generates poor black
1013565 GIMP plugin may not exit at completion


================================================================

While Gimp-Print 5.0 is not finalized, it contains many improvements
and changes from 4.2, as follows:

* General User-Visible Changes:

  1) In general, Gimp-Print 5.0 is not compatible with Gimp-Print 4.2.
     Gimp-Print 5.0 offers many new options (which are described
     separately below), and many options that are present in both 4.2
     and 5.0 function differently in the two releases.  In addition,
     the API is different.  Finally, the color correction is quite
     different, and profiles created against the 4.2 driver will not
     function well against the 5.0 driver.

  2) In addition to all of the printers supported in 4.2, a variety of
     Olympus and Sony photo printers are supported in this release.

  3) Options in the CUPS driver and GIMP plugin are now grouped
     according to function.  This work is still in progress, and
     further usability improvements are expected.

  4) Simplified bundles of settings are now offered for users who do
     not need to customize the settings.  The Print Quality and Image
     Type controls offer a variety of settings optimized for common
     printing tasks.  Both controls offer Manual Control settings for
     users who wish greater control over the output.

  5) Many of the color settings have changed effect.  We recommend
     starting with no color correction and making appropriate changes
     only as required.  Specific changes that you should be aware of
     include:

     * The default operation of the contrast setting has changed to be
       more in accord with standard practice.  In 4.2, reducing the
       contrast resulted in changing the black and white setting.  In
       5.0, reducing the contrast does not change the black and white
       settings.  As a result, it is possible to use the contrast
       setting to improve highlight and shadow detail by reducing the
       contrast.

       The old behavior is available by turning on the "Linear
       Contrast Adjustment".

     * The brightness control now behaves more appropriately,
       adjusting the image's overall brightness without changing the
       black or white points.

     * The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow settings have been replaced with
       separate settings for gamma and density for Cyan, Magenta,
       Yellow, and Black.  The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow settings in
       Gimp-Print 4.2 most closely correspond to the gamma settings in
       5.0.

       The per-channel density settings do not affect the color
       correction.  They are applied after the color correction to
       scale the individual channels.


* New Functionality:

  1) This release offers a new curve data type, permitting very
     precise adjustments of output.

  2) This release offers many new output controls:

     + Balance (density) controls for each channel, in addition to the
       gamma controls present in 4.2.

     + Black (GCR) transition, including the transition gamma and the
       upper and lower limits.

     + Transitions for photo (light cyan and light magenta) inks.

     + Transfer curves for each channel (cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
       and composite), allowing very precise control over the output.

     + Hue, saturation, and luminosity transfer curves.

     + Ink limit control.

     + The density control now permits setting density as high as 8.0,
       vs. 2.0 in 4.2.

  3) The Epson driver offers (almost) true full bleed for printers
     that support it (but see the limitations below).

  4) The PCL driver now offers duplex (two sided) printing support on
     appropriate printers.

  5) The package now includes support for a number of dye sublimation
     photo printers made by Olympus, Canon, Sony, and Fujifilm.

  6) The resolution list for Epson printers has been simplified; many
     redundant resolutions have been removed.

  7) Print head directional for Epson printers (unidirectional
     vs. bidirectional) is now a separate control.  In addition to
     contributing to the simplification of the Epson printer
     resolutions, this permits the choice of unidirectional
     vs. bidirectional at all resolutions.

  8) The Epson driver now allows printing directly to CD's on printers
     that support this functionality.

  9) The Epson driver now offers a choice of print head weave
     patterns.  In addition to simplifying the resolution choices for
     Epson Stylus Pro printers, this offers an additional control for
     fine tuning output quality.

  10) The Epson driver offers an Ink Set control for printers taking
     different choices of inks (such as the Epson Stylus Photo 2200,
     which offers a choice of Matte Black and Photo Black inks).

  11) The Epson driver permits adjusting the dot size if required to
     increase the amount of ink printed.  For example, if 1440x720 DPI
     is selected, but the density requested is very high, the printer
     will switch to using drop sizes appropriate for 720 DPI.  This
     option is disabled by default.

  12) Where practical, all controls offer a default setting for
     simplicity of operation.  This default value is intended to offer
     the optimal choice given the printer and its other settings.  For
     example, if "Automatic" is selected for print head direction, the
     print head motion will be unidirectional at high resolutions
     (since unidirectional usually produces better output), but
     bidirectional at low resolutions (for faster printing).

     The default is only offered for options that are not directly
     controlled by the user's action.  For example, there is no
     default choice offered for paper type, since the correct value is
     based on the paper type loaded by the user.  Similarly, there is
     no default for the input slot or ink set.

  13) Support for a variety of input types, in both 8 and 16 bit
     resolution, has been added.  Gimp-Print can now handle input in
     grayscale, whitescale (inverted grayscale), RGB, CMY, CMYK, and
     KCMY in 8 and 16 bit resolutions for all output types.

  14) A new Threshold color correction mode has been added that
     produces either all-on or all-off of each color.  This is similar
     to the Monochrome mode in 4.2, except that it works for color as
     well as black.

  15) A new Desaturated color correction mode has been added that
     produces gray (desaturated) output using color inks.

  16) A new Density color correction mode has been added that corrects
     only for density.  This will normally produce excessively dark
     output.  However, applications that wish to use their own
     linearization curves may wish to use this interface to prevent
     Gimp-Print from performing its own linearization.

  17) A new Raw color correction mode has been added that performs no
     correction whatsoever on the input.  This mode may be used by
     applications that wish to perform their own ink limiting and
     linearization, and use Gimp-Print to perform dithering
     (screening) and output generation only.

  18) A new Predithered color correction mode has been added that
     combines the effects of Raw and Threshold.  This mode may be used
     by applications that wish to perform their own dithering and use
     Gimp-Print to generate printer-specific output only.


* Changes to the Print plugin for the GIMP:

  1) A new plugin for the GIMP 2.0 is now provided.  At present it is
     experimental.  In the long run it will be distributed with the
     GIMP rather than with Gimp-Print.  This is anticipated for the
     GIMP 2.2 release.

  2) The Print plugin for the GIMP 1.2 is now deprecated and will be
     withdrawn in 5.1 (the development release following 5.0).  The
     Print plugin for the GIMP 1.2 will continue to be supported in
     all 5.0 releases, but no new functionality will be added
     following the release of 5.0.0.

  3) The plugin now always displays the page preview with the top of
     the page at the top of the preview pane, rotating the image
     preview as necessary to display landscape or portrait mode.

  4) The positioning controls have been simplified.

  5) The printrc file format is different.  Gimp-Print 5.0 can read
     printrc files created by Gimp-Print 4.2 and earlier, but it
     writes out the printrc file in a format that earlier versions of
     Gimp-Print cannot read.

  6) Printer queue discovery and command specification are greatly
     simplified over 4.2.  The plugin now offers a default printing
     command that is determined based on the characteristics of the
     system, and also offers the choice of printing to a file or using
     a custom print command for each printer defined in the printrc
     file.  The default printing command is correct whether the output
     is Postscript or not.

  7) The Print plugin now always displays all options relevant to
     what's being printed, enabling and disabling options as
     appropriate.

  8) If you are using an older version of the GIMP 1.2, and the GIMP
     is installed in a non-standard location on your system such that
     you cannot run configure in Gimp-Print without using
     --with-gimp-prefix or --with-gimp-exec-prefix, please read item
     (10) in Exceptions and Workarounds below.  In addition, if you
     have both the GIMP 1.3/2.0 and the GIMP 1.2 installed on your
     system, you should read the same material.


* Changes to the CUPS driver:

  1) The CUPS PPD files now offer both fine and coarse adjustments for
     all color controls, permitting much finer control over output (in
     steps of .005 rather than .05).

  2) The CUPS driver refuses to function with PPD files created for a
     different version of Gimp-Print, providing an error message
     indicating the problem.  This avoids problems caused by
     mismatches between the PPD files and the driver.  While
     mismatches are potentially not harmful in all cases, they could
     cause problems ranging from failures to print with poor
     diagnostic messages to incorrect results.

  3) The Gimp-Print 5.0 CUPS driver can be installed concurrently with
     the 4.2 driver.  Both the PPD files and the driver carry
     different names from their 4.2 counterparts, permitting a gradual
     switchover between 4.2 and 5.0-based releases.

  4) An update script (cups-genppdupdate.5.0) is provided to update
     PPD files between recent 4.3 and 5.0-based releases, preserving
     option values where possible.  This script will not update PPD
     files based on Gimp-Print 4.2, or Gimp-Print 4.3 releases prior
     to 4.3.21.

  5) Due to the implementation of CUPS, it is necessary on some
     systems to link the programs associated with the CUPS driver (in
     particular, cups-genppd and rastertogimpprint) statically against
     the Gimp-Print library.  Please see bugs 865253 and 865265 for
     full details.

     This fix works correctly unless --disable-static (to disable
     building static libraries) is passed on the command line.
     Normally, only people packaging up Gimp-Print for distribution
     use this option.  If you wish to use this option, please read
     item (9) Exceptions and Workarounds *carefully* for a full
     description of the problem along with suggested methods of
     procedure.


* Changes to the Ghostscript driver:

  1) The stp driver, a monolithic (traditional) Ghostscript driver
     used with Ghostscript 5.10, 5.50, and 6.51, has been withdrawn.
     The only supported Ghostscript driver is the IJS-based driver,
     for GNU Ghostscript 6.53 and above, ESP Ghostscript 7.05 and
     above, and AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 and above.

     This change was made due to the difficulty of supporting the
     monolithic driver and the complexity of building it.  The
     traditional monolithic driver architecture required that all
     drivers be compiled into Ghostscript, requiring that program to
     be recompiled whenever a driver is added.  This is a rather
     complicated operation that cannot easily be automated.  The IJS
     architecture, based on the open source HPIJS driver supplied by
     Hewlett-Packard for HP inkjet printers, allows for drivers to be
     compiled independently of the core Ghostscript.  A Gimp-Print
     driver based on the IJS architecture was introduced into
     Gimp-Print 4.2.1 and 4.3.0, and has been recommended for use with
     Gimp-Print 4.2.2 and beyond.

     In addition to a greatly simplified build procedure and overall
     cleaner architecture, the separation between Ghostscript and
     driver imposed by the IJS architecture permits use of Gimp-Print
     with AFPL Ghostscript with no license conflict.


* Quality Improvements:

  1) Color and tonal accuracy is greatly improved compared to 4.2
     while the gamut (range of printable colors) has been increased.
     This particularly improves the hue accuracy of red, magenta, and
     blue, and the tonal accuracy of cyan and green.  Most Epson
     printers have been fully tuned for the new color correction
     algorithms introduced for this release.

  2) The handling of variable drop sizes and photo inks (6 and 7 color
     printers) has been completely rewritten, with the result being
     that variable drop size printers with photo inks (such as most
     Epson Stylus Photo and Stylus Pro printers) give much more
     consistent results with fewer artifacts.  In particular, colors
     match correctly across all resolutions, which was not the case in
     4.2.

     In 4.2, variable size drops and light inks were treated the same
     way; an "effective drop size" based on the relative size of the
     drops and the darkness of the inks was used to decide what kind
     of drop to print.  While this method has some advantages (it
     ensures that dark and light inks are never printed at the same
     place, and also that dark dots are optimally dispersed among
     light dots), it has some serious disadvantages as well: the
     properties of a small dark dot and a large light dot are not
     really the same, particularly when inks are mixed.  The
     combination of different drop sizes being used at different
     resolutions meant that the transition between light and dark inks
     differed depending upon the resolution chosen, and if more than
     one drop size was required at a given resolution, the transition
     tended to be quite marked.

     The new method of handling variable size drops and light inks is
     to first separate each of the four channels (cyan, magenta,
     yellow, and black) into the appropriate light and dark inks, if
     needed.  This separation is performed based on the relative
     darkness of the different ink sub-colors (such as light and dark
     cyan) and specific characteristics of the printer, ink type, and
     paper chosen.  Following this, each sub-color is screened
     separately, and the appropriate combination of drop sizes is
     chosen.

     The drop size selection in this release has also been changed to
     fill the page with as many small drops as possible before
     switching to larger drops.  This ensures that the largest number
     of the smallest possible drops is printed, which yields a
     smoother texture in the midtones.

     Finally, new dither algorithms described below allow drops of ink
     of different colors to be dispersed, avoiding clumping or
     overprinting of drops.

  3) The EvenTone dither algorithm has been extensively reworked in
     this release, offering many improvements.

     First, it has been rewritten to work correctly with variable drop
     size and photo printers.  This algorithm, which offers
     significant improvements over the standard Adaptive Hybrid
     algorithm, does not work optimally with variable drop sizes or
     photo printers in 4.2.

     Secondly, several variations on this algorithm have been
     introduced, yielding a family of high quality screening
     algorithms for different applications.  The first variation is
     called Hybrid EvenTone.  This dither algorithm perturbs the dot
     positions slightly to break up some patterning seen in standard
     EvenTone dithering in solid regions of pale tones, particularly
     when printing with black ink only.  This very slightly reduces
     the smoothness of texture in exchange for largely eliminating
     this undesirable patterning.  This algorithm is also expected to
     be more resistant to microbanding effects.

     The second variation is called UniTone.  This dither algorithm
     calculates the placement of all dots (except for yellow) using a
     single EvenTone pass, not just all of the dots of one color.
     This technique improves the quality when multiple inks must be
     mixed, such as when color inks are used to produce gray.  It does
     so by ensuring that all dots are equally spaced.  Typically when
     printing neutral tones with EvenTone dithering the cyan, magenta,
     and yellow dots are positioned very close to each other, even
     though the individual cyan dots are well-positioned.  This causes
     the groups of dots to appear to be single, large dots.  UniTone
     dithering evens out the spacing between all dots, producing a
     smoother texture.  UniTone dithering only functions when printing
     in color (or grayscale with multi-tone gray ink); when printing
     with black ink only, it is exactly equivalent to EvenTone
     dithering.  UniTone dithering is generally slower than EvenTone.

     UniTone dithering works best at improving output when the drops
     are already very small, which is usually at high resolutions.
     With these small drops, the eye has difficulty distinguishing the
     color of the individual drops, so their color tends to be
     distinguished primarily by their darkness.  While cyan ink is
     lighter than black ink and magenta ink is lighter than cyan ink,
     these differences are not overwhelming and hence the eye does not
     perceive a difference between them.  With large drops, the eye
     perceives the color of the individual drops, and small spots
     dominated by one ink become apparent.

     As noted above, UniTone dithers yellow separately.  This is
     because the yellow ink is much lighter than any other ink, and
     the positions occupied by yellow drops appear as holes, reducing
     the quality of the print.  Even light cyan and light magenta inks
     appear to be significantly darker than yellow.

     Experiments conducted to date suggest that UniTone works very
     well on the printers such as the Epson Stylus C80 at high
     resolutions, when the printer is using 3 picolitre drops.  On the
     Stylus Photo EX, at 1440x720 DPI, using 8 picolitre drops,
     quality is improved significantly when printing in normal 6-color
     mode but quality is slightly worse in 4-color mode, as the colors
     of the drops are apparent.  At 720 DPI (using 12 picolitre
     drops), quality is improved in 6-color mode but degraded
     significantly in 4-color mode.

     Finally, a Hybrid UniTone dither algorithm is provided, combining
     the principles of both of the above.

     As noted above, UniTone dithering does not always work better
     than EvenTone, although in most cases all of these algorithms
     work much better than Adaptive Hybrid in 4.2.  We suggest that
     users requiring the highest quality experiment, using Hybrid
     EvenTone as a baseline.

  4) The conversion between black and composite (CMY) gray has been
     improved in this release, yielding more neutral grays on most
     printers.

  5) Epson printers have been completely retuned, in most cases
     yielding much better density, more accurate gray scale, and
     darker blac on all paper types.


* Exceptions and Workarounds:

  1) Full bleed mode does not work completely correctly on most Epson
     printers at present.  Typically there is a small margin at the
     bottom of the page (1-2 mm) and possibly a very small margin at
     the top.  However, it works correctly along the left and right
     margins.  We do not have an estimated time for a fix.

  2) The Canon, Hewlett-Packard, and Lexmark drivers do not offer all
     of the additional options and improvements that the Epson driver
     does.  We do not have an estimated time for fix.  Please contact
     us if you would like to assist with this.

  3) Translation to other languages other than US-English is not
     supported in this release.  This will be fixed prior to 5.0 final
     release.

  4) Support for the Canon S200 has not yet been ported forward from
     4.2.

  5) This release is slower than 4.2 in many cases, particularly when
     using High Accuracy (which is the default color correction in
     most cases) or Bright color correction.  It is possible that this
     release will not be able to drive some printers at full speed,
     particularly if your computer has a slow processor.  Performance
     has been only partially analyzed or tuned at present.  We hope to
     improve the performance prior to final release.

  6) The user's manual and developer's guide have not been updated for
     this release.

  7) The CUPS PPD update script (cups-genppdupdate.5.0) will not
     update PPD files from 4.2 or from 4.3 prior to 4.3.21.  This is a
     permanent restriction.

  8) With certain versions of CUPS and in certain non-default
     configurations, if a new version of Gimp-Print is installed over
     an existing version genppd will create PPD files based on the
     older version of Gimp-Print rather than the newer version.  This
     will happen if all of the following are true:

     1) The cups-config provided by the CUPS driver adds
        -Wl,rpath=/usr/lib. This is done by some versions of CUPS
        reportedly because in some cases the runtime linker does not
        pick up libraries out of /usr/lib.  This can be checked by
        running

        cups-config --libs --ldflags

        and inspecting the output for any mention of "rpath", "RPATH",
        "RUN_PATH", or the like.  This is controlled by the CUPS
        installation on your system.

     2) There is presently a version of Gimp-Print installed in /usr
        (--prefix=/usr) rather than /usr/local or the like.  The
        default location of Gimp-Print installation is in /usr/local,
        but system vendors typically install Gimp-Print in /usr.

     3) Gimp-Print is built dynamically only (--disable-static).  This
        is not a default, and requires the explicit --disable-static
        on the Gimp-Print "configure" command line.  Therefore, if you
        build Gimp-Print normally you should not be vulnerable to this
        problem.

     Note that in general if you install CUPS into a non-standard
     location, and install Gimp-Print into the same location, this
     problem can surface.  For example, if you choose to install CUPS
     in /usr/local and Gimp-Print in /usr/local you are vulnerable to
     this.  However, it is not standard practice to install CUPS
     anywhere but /usr.

     In this case, the run path embedded in the genppd executable
     points to the version of Gimp-Print installed in /usr/lib. This
     run path overrides any attempt by libtool to look in the build
     directory. The result is that cups-genppd and rastertogimpprint
     are run against the older version of Gimp-Print. If the new
     version contains additional features (more printers, etc.) they
     will not be available.

     This bug is difficult to detect in a normal build.  It does not
     cause an error to happen during build; the only failure is that
     some PPD files may not be built or may be built with missing
     options.  Due to the PPD version checking introduced in this
     release, the behavior might manifest itself as a runtime error.
     It is also possible that there will be no error at all other than
     the older version of Gimp-Print being used, with the result that
     new features and bug fixes are not available.

     If you wish to use only shared libraries, do not wish to build
     static libraries at all, and are vulnerable to this issue
     (because cups-config --ldflags sets the run path), there are
     three workarounds available:

     1) Build and install Gimp-Print into /usr (rather than
        /usr/local) and then rebuild Gimp-Print from scratch.  This
        will install the correct libgimpprint.so in /usr/lib, and in
        the rebuild genppd will be run against the correct library.

     2) Remove the old version of Gimp-Print prior to building the new
        version of Gimp-Print.  The important files to remove are
        anything named /usr/lib/libgimpprint*.

     3) Edit cups-config to remove the reference to the run path.

  9) The fix for bug 929227 (Gimp-Print incorrectly attempts to build
     against GIMP 2.0) requires special build instructions if you are
     using a very old version of the GIMP 1.2 (versions affected are
     believed to include 1.2.0, 1.2.1, and 1.2.2).  Specifically, you
     must set GIMPTOOL in the environment to point to the proper
     version of gimptool when running Gimp-Print's configure script.
     For example:

     GIMPTOOL=/usr/bin/gimptool ./configure

     The bug fix involves checking for the presence of the GIMP
     slightly differently from how it was previously done.
     Previously, Gimp-Print checked for the presence of a program
     named "gimptool", which provides information about how to build
     plugins against the GIMP.  This worked correctly when only the
     GIMP 1.2 was installed, but not when the GIMP 2.0 was installed.

     The GIMP 2.0 actually installs a program named "gimptool-2.0",
     and creates a symbolic link named "gimptool" pointing to it.
     Later versions of the GIMP 1.2 (1.2.3, 1.2.4, 1.2.5, and any
     later versions that may be released) similarly create a program
     named "gimptool-1.2" and a symbolic link named "gimptool".
     As the configure script prior to this bug fix simply checked for
     gimptool, it incorrectly detected a gimptool from the GIMP 2.0,
     which this version of Gimp-Print cannot build against.

     The current configure script checks first for gimptool-1.2 and
     then for gimptool, and only accepts the use of a GIMP 1.2 version
     of one of these programs.  However, if you have one of the older
     versions of the GIMP 1.2 installed in a non-standard location,
     and you use --with-gimp-prefix or --with-gimp-exec-prefix to
     specify its location, the configure script will not automatically
     detect the correct location of gimptool, and you must specify it
     as described above.  Note that you must specify a copy of
     gimptool from the GIMP 1.2, not from the GIMP 2.0.  If your copy
     of the GIMP is installed in a standard location (typically
     /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin), you do not need to use
     --with-gimp-prefix or --with-gimp-exec-prefix, and therefore do
     not need to use this workaround.

     The Gimp-Print and GIMP projects recommend upgrading to a newer
     revision of the GIMP 1.2 (at the time these release notes are
     written, the latest version is 1.2.5), which will not require
     this workaround.  This workaround is available in the event that
     you cannot or do not wish to upgrade your installation of the
     GIMP.


* Architectural Changes:

  1) A modular architecture for family drivers.  A "family driver" is
     a collection of printer drivers for one group of printers sharing
     a common programming architecture, e. g. ESC/P2, PCL, Lexmark,
     Canon.

  2) A modular architecture for color processing.  This architecture
     will enable us, or others, to provide color management without
     having to change the internal interfaces within Gimp-Print.

  3) New composite data types.  Gimp-Print 5.0 defines additional data
     types.  These types include:

     * Sequences, curves, and arrays.  A sequence is a primitive
       vector of numbers data type; curves and arrays provide
       additional capabilities such as interpolation (for curves) and
       multiple dimensions (for arrays).

     * Lists are a general ordered container of named objects of
       arbitrary type.  They are used throughout the core library in a
       variety of ways.  The creator of a list can specify
       constructor, destructor, name comparison, copy, and sort
       operations on list members.

     * Parameters, which are part of the options system described
       below.  In addition to storing values and descriptions of the
       parameter, parameters can be queried to determine defaults and
       constraints.  Parameter lists (which use the list container
       internally) are also defined as part of this.

     * String lists are used in various ways; in particular, they are
       used by the parameter system to inform programs of the
       available choices of values for string-valued parameters.

  4) Complete overhaul of the options system.  Rather than offering a
     fixed set of operations, family drivers, color modules, etc. can
     now offer a wide variety of options using a predefined set of
     data types.  The data types currently supported are strings
     picked from a list, floating point numbers, integers, curves,
     arrays, Boolean values, dimensions, and filenames.

     The new options system provides a flexible way for drivers to
     inform applications of default values and UI hints, the ability
     to selectively enable and disable options, and a generalized way
     of verifying legality of option choices.

  5) The coordinate system has been changed from bottom left to top
     left of the page, and the printable area can now extend beyond
     the edge of the page.  The result is a more intuitive coordinate
     system for driver writers that matches the coordinate system of
     printers, and the ability to do true full bleed.

  6) The specification of color correction, input, and output modes
     has been completely revised, permitting applications to specify
     input mode, output mode, channel bit depth, and color correction
     completely independently.  This architecture is also more
     extensible.

  7) Complete overhaul of the black generation in CMYK output.  Black
     generation is now performed in the color code rather than the
     dither code.  This simplifies the dither code, puts the CMYK
     generation where it should be, and improves overall flexibility.

  8) Complete overhaul of the multi-tone (photo or quadtone) ink
     processing architecture (channels).  Instead of being processed
     as part of the dithering code as in 4.2, where ink drops of
     lighter inks were assigned virtual values proportional to their
     darkness as well as their size, this is now processed after the
     initial color conversion.  This has a number of major advantages:

     * As the actual amount of ink to be printed is visible to the
       color code, the color code can do ink limiting without fear
       that the dither code will change the amount of ink to be
       printed.

     * It ensures that the same proportions of inks will be printed at
       any density and resolution.  In 4.2, the ramp from light to
       dark ink varied depending upon the dot sizes available and
       hence the resolution.  This has already been demonstrated to
       yield much better linearity and much more neutral gray scale
       with even very modest tuning effort.

     * It enables use of all drop sizes of all ink tones.  In 4.2, we
       could not use the smallest drop size of dark ink, because the
       virtual dot size of a small dot of dark ink is typically close
       to the virtual dot size of a large dot of small ink.  This
       would yield very sharp transition, and perhaps even result in
       more light ink printed in darker regions than in lighter
       regions.  With channel processing separate from dithering, this
       concern no longer exists; we can safely use small drops of dark
       ink, improving smoothness.

     * It enables the color code to do ink limiting intelligently
       without concern that the dither code will rearrange things
       behind its back.

     * It greatly simplifies the specification of inks.  With drop
       size and darkness orthogonal, family drivers can greatly
       simplify their tables of inks.

     * Dither algorithms can choose to ignore smaller drop sizes if
       they wish to offer fast operation.

     * Applications with special requirements can now access the raw
       ink channels directly.  This facility was used to create a
       mechanism to more accurately tune printer inks.

  9) Use of true XML to store data about printers and paper sizes, and
     to represent new data types (sequences, curves, and arrays).
     This uses the "mxml" XML library, a fast, lightweight XML parser
     written by Mike Sweet for this project.  Currently, the use of
     XML (as opposed to compiled-in data) is limited, but we expect
     that this will change beyond the initial 5.0 release.

  10) In addition to parameters, internal components such as family
     drivers, color drivers, etc. can store arbitrary data in the
     basic stp_vars_t object.  This facility is used to simplify the
     internal driver API; the family driver no longer needs to keep
     track of dither, color, etc. information itself.

  11) The Epson Stylus family driver has been decomposed into more
     functionally distinct units.  The data schema has been
     considerably improved, and the code itself broken into more
     easily maintained units.

  12) The build system has been updated with a more contemporary
     toolchain based on autoconf 2.5 and gettext 0.11.

  13) The Print plugin for the GIMP has been decomposed into a UI
     library and the core plugin.  The user interface library is a
     pure GTK-based library; the tiny GIMP plugin is a client of this
     library.

  14) Printer characteristics are exposed to the application level as
     read-only parameters.  This permits the escputil utility to not
     duplicate information stored in the printer driver.
================================================================


Supported Printers:

Many variations on these printers are also supported.  Generally, the
Epson printers are fully supported, although not fully tuned in all
cases; the Canon, HP, and Lexmark printers vary.

Our practice is to provide preliminary support for printers as soon as
we have information sufficient to code a functioning driver, and to
release this support even in an otherwise stable release.  In this
case, we note in the list below that support for a particular printer
is "Experimental".  It is likely that printers that are supported in
"Experimental" mode will produce poor quality at some or all
resolutions and in addition may not function correctly at some
resolutions.  Experimental Epson printers are most likely to produce
good output at the highest resolution offered (2880x720, 2880x1440, or
2880x2880 DPI), since in general these printers will not use multiple
drop sizes at such high resolutions.

Please see the printer-specific notes section following the list of
printers for any instructions specific to your printer.

these printers may work only partially; the specified drivers may not
support the full range of resolutions, paper sizes, media sources,

================================================================

Printer-Specific Notes:

    * It is strongly recommended that four color mode not be used on
      the Epson Stylus C63, C64, C65, C66, C70, C80, C82, C83, C84,
      C85, C86, and CX-5200, and the PX-V500 and PX-V600 when printing
      to glossy papers, as the black ink is formulated differently
      from the color ink and does not adhere properly to these papers.
      Epson Photo Paper, Premium Glossy Photo Paper, Premium Luster
      Photo Paper, and Premium Semigloss Photo Paper are known to be
      affected.  If you use the Standard ink type, this will be
      handled automatically.

    * The Epson Stylus C70, C80, and C82 appear to support resolutions
      of 1440x1440 and 2880x1440, but these resolutions may not yield
      any improvement over 2880x720 or even 1440x720 DPI.  Due to
      improvements in the driver, these extremely high resolutions
      will offer very little if any improvement when printing
      photographs or other continuous-tone images.  For printing line
      art with extremely fine detail these resolutions may offer some
      improvement due to the nature of the printed image.  We expect
      that 1440x1440 would yield maximum improvement over 2880x720 on
      line art with very fine detail.  It is unlikely that 2880x1440
      would yield any significant additional improvement.

      Note that these resolutions are not officially supported by
      Epson on the C70 and C80, and may not work on all C70 and C80
      printers.

    * The Gimp-Print Epson driver does not support the 5760 DPI
      resolutions (5760x720 or 5760x1440 DPI) offered by some Epson
      printers.  We do not believe that these resolutions offer any
      advantage over 2880x720 or 2880x1440 DPI, and indeed they may
      not offer any advantage over 1440x720 or 1440x1440 DPI.  No
      current Epson printer requires a resolution higher than
      2880x1440 DPI to fill the page with the smallest drop size used,
      and the effective resolution is generally determined by the
      lower of the horizontal and vertical resolution.  Raising the
      horizontal resolution without a corresponding increase in the
      vertical resolution merely requires more computation and
      printing time without yielding significantly better quality.

      We do not currently plan to offer resolutions higher than
      2880x2880 DPI on any Epson Stylus printer with a drop size of 1
      pl or larger.  At the time of Gimp-Print 5.0 Beta, the smallest
      drop size offered by any Epson Stylus printer is 1.5 pl.  If
      such a printer is offered, we will evaluate whether to offer
      higher resolutions.

    * Many Epson printers (specifically, the Epson Stylus Color 740
      and all newer printers) will not respond to ASCII text without a
      special "activation" sequence (specifically, this command takes
      the printers out of "packet mode").  A brand new printer, or one
      that has been connected to a Windows system, may or may not work
      in packet mode.  Therefore, the common suggestion to test a
      printer port by sending plain text to it may not work for these
      printers; failure to print in this fashion is not a positive
      indication that the printer or the connection is malfunctioning.
      These printers are, however, able to print plain text *after*
      the activation sequence is sent.

      A suggestion would be to use the escputil command to print a
      test pattern:

      escputil -n -u -P printer

      or

      escputil -n -u -r /dev/lp0

      The `-u' option will send the activation sequence.  In addition
      to printing the test pattern (if at least unidirectional
      communication is set up), this will enable printing plain ASCII
      text, at least until the printer is powered off (or used under
      Windows).

      To test bidirectional communication, the command

      escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0

      is a good choice, as it will print (to the screen) the amount of
      ink in the printer.

      Note that this activation sequence is both unnecessary and
      incorrect on older printers.

      The current list of printers for which the activation sequence
      must be sent is:

      All Epson Stylus C-series printers (e. g. C20SX, C80)
      All Epson Stylus Photo printers except for the original Stylus
          Photo, Stylus Photo 700, Stylus Photo 710, and Stylus Photo
          EX (the Stylus Photo EX3 does require the sequence)
      All Epson Stylus CX-series multi-function devices (e. g. CX-3100)
      All Epson Stylus Scan multi-function devices
      The following Epson Stylus Color printers:
