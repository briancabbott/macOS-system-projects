.TH GIMPPRINT\-COLOR 7 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GIMPPRINT_VERSION@" "Gimp-Print Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
gimpprint\-color \- Gimp-Print color balancing
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gimp-Print includes several color balancing controls.  These may be
used to adjust the original image's brightness and contrast and gamma,
and the density and saturation of the output, as well as the
individual cyan, magenta and yellow levels.
.SH COLOR BALANCING
.TP
.B Cyan
.TP
.B Magenta
.TP
.B Yellow
The range of values is 0.0 \- 4.0, and defaults to 1.0.  These three
options allow specification of the cyan, magenta, and yellow levels
independently, for rebalancing the levels.  Normally, these should be
adjusted to yield neutral gray, but they can be used for other
effects.
.TP
.B Brightness
The range of values is 0.0 \- 2.0, and defaults to 1.0.  This adjusts
the brightness of the image.  0.0 gives a fully black image; 2.0 gives
a fully white image.  Values greater than 1 will result in black not
being solid and highlights turning white; values less than 1 will
result in white not being perfectly clear and shadows turning black.
.TP
.B Contrast
The range of values is 0.0 \- 4.0, and defaults to 1.0.  Adjust the
contrast of the image.  0.0 gives a solid gray for the entire image,
the exact gray depending upon the brightness chosen.
.TP
.B Gamma
The range of values is 0.1 \- 4.0, and defaults to 1.0.  Adjust the
gamma of the image, over and above the printer-specific correction.
Gamma less than 1.0 will result in a darker image; gamma greater than
1.0 will result in a lighter image.  Unlike brightness, gamma
adjustment does not change the endpoints; it merely changes the shape
of the input\(->output curve.
.TP
.B Density
The range of values is 0.1 \- 2.0, and defaults to 1.0.  Adjust the
amount of ink deposited on the paper.  If you've chosen the correct
paper type and you're getting ink bleeding through the paper or
puddling, try reducing the density to the lowest value you can while
still achieving solid black.  If you're not getting solid black, even
with the contrast and brightness at 1.0, try increasing the density.
.IP
All of the printers supported here actually need less than 100% ink density in
most cases, so the actual density is something other than the nominal density
setting.  The effective density setting cannot go above 100%, so if a value
specified will result in an excessively high density level, it will be silently
limited to 1.0.
.TP
.B Saturation
The range of values is 0.0 \- 9.0, and defaults to 1.0.  Adjust the
brilliance of colors.  0.0 results in pure grayscale; using this with
Color=1 is one way of getting grayscale (see below under "Color" for a
full discussion).  Saturation of less than 1.0 results in more muted
colors; saturation of greater than 1.0 results in more vibrant colors.
Very high saturation often results in very strange effects, including
posterization and banding that might not be expected.  For normal
purposes, the saturation should generally be less than 1.5.
