.SH NAME
gimpprint\-config \- script to get information about the installed version of gimpprint

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gimpprint\-config
[\-\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fP] [\-\-exec\-prefix\fI[=DIR]\fP] [\-\-version] [\-\-libs] [\-\-cflags]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIgimpprint\-config\fP is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and
linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use
\fIGimp-Print\fP. It is also used internally to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf
that are included with \fIGimp-Print\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIgimpprint\-config\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fIGimp-Print\fP on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a \fIGimp-Print\fP program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a \fIGimp-Print\fP program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that \fIGimp-Print\fP
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-exec\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that
\fIGimp-Print\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
