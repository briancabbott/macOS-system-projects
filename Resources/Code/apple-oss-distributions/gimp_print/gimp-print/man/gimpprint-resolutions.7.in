.TH GIMPPRINT\-RESOLUTIONS 7 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GIMPPRINT_VERSION@" "Gimp-Print Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
gimpprint\-resolutions \- Gimp-Print print resolutions
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gimp-Print supports many different resolutions, which are printer type
specific.  The option names are case sensitive.  Not all resolutions are
supported on all printers.
.SH PRINT RESOLUTONS
.SS Epson Stylus printers
Within each specified resolution, the quality is generally listed from worst to
best (and generally higher quality means lower speed).  For example, \fI360 DPI
Unidirectional\fP is usually better than \fI360 DPI\fP.  Characteristics of
specific models and individual printers may affect the orderings to some
degree; on many printers, with certain papers, unidirectional printing will
improve quality substantially more than using an otherwise better quality
printing mode.
.PP
The difference between different quality settings lies in the number
of passes made over each line.  "High" and "Highest" quality settings
perform more passes, printing fewer dots with each pass over the same
line and using different nozzles for each pass.  This reduces banding
effects, but requires more time.
.PP
We generally recommend the following resolutions for the following
purposes:

360	T{
Standard quality output on plain paper (output will be solidly black); draft

720x360	T{
High quality output on plain paper; standard output on good
quality inkjet paper.
T}
720	T{
Maximum quality on plain paper; high quality on good inkjet paper; proofs on
photo-quality paper.  On many printers, there will be little difference between
this and 720x360 on plain paper.
T}
1440x720	T{
High quality on photo paper; use 1440x720 Highest Quality to reduce
microbanding if needed.  While this will work on plain paper, it usually offers
little improvement over 720 DPI.
T}
2880x720	T{
Highest quality on photo paper.  While this may yield slightly improved
quality, it will generally not be markedly superior to 1440x720 Highest
Quality, except on the Stylus Color 980 and Stylus C70 and C80, where it may
yield a noticeable improvement.  It takes as long to print as 1440x720 highest
quality, but twice as long to generate the output.
T}
1440x1440	T{
An unsupported mode that offers higher quality than 2880x720 for certain types
of images on very high quality paper.  It does not appear to offer any
advantage on smooth tones, but fine detail (particularly vertical, and to a
lesser extent near-horizontal) it shows noticeable improvement.  It takes as
long to print as 2880x720.  1440x1440 highest quality takes twice as long to
print.
T}
2880x1440	T{
An unsupported mode that may offer higher quality than 2880x720 for certain
types of images on very high quality paper.  Experiments conducted thus far
demonstrate little if any improvement over 1440x1440.  It takes twice as long
to print as 2880x720 or 1440x1440, and as long to print as 1440x1440 highest
quality.

.IP *
This setting is the default on all printers supporting this setting
except for the PM-930C and PM-970C, which support no resolution lower
than 720x360 DPI.
.IP 1
Works on printers that have a basic vertical spacing of 1/90".  This
includes the Stylus Color, Stylus Color 440, 460, 600, 640, 660, 670,
and 1500, and Stylus Photo, Stylus Photo 700, 720, and EX.
.IP 2
Works on the Stylus Color 640 and 660.
.IP 3
Works on most printers that have a basic vertical spacing of 1/90,
1/180, or 1/360 inch.  This includes Stylus Color, Stylus Color 440,
460, 600, 640, 660, 670, 800, 850, 900, 980, 1500, 1520, 3000, and
Stylus Photo, Stylus Photo 700, 720 and EX.

Works on Stylus Color 640 and 660; Stylus C70, C80, and C82; and
Stylus Photo 950, 960, 2100, 2200, and PM-950C
.IP 5
Works on older printers with dot spacing of 1/120 inch.  This includes
the Stylus Color Pro, Pro XL, 400, and 500.
.IP 6

480, 580, 680, 740, 760, 777, 860, 880, 83, and 1160, and the Stylus
Photo 750, 780, 785, 790, 810, 820, 825, 830, 870, 875, 890, 895, 900,

.IP 8
Works on all printers that do support variable drop sizes.  This
includes all supported Epson Stylus printers except for those listed
in note (6).
.IP 9
This setting prints at particularly high speed on the Epson Stylus
Photo 950, 960, 2100, and 2200, and the PM-950C when used in color
with three or four color mode, or with grayscale in any mode other
than two or seven color.
.IP 10
Works on all supported printers except for Stylus Color, Stylus Color
Pro, Stylus Color Pro XL, Stylus Color 1500, 1520, and 3000.  On
printers that do not support variable drop size (see note (4)), this
will print as fast as 360 DPI, and faster than 360 DPI High Quality.
It will take twice as long to generate output, which may be important
on a heavily loaded system or a processor slower than 200 MHz.
.IP 11
This is the default resolution on the PM-930C and PM-970C.
.IP 12
This setting prints at particularly high speed on the Epson PM-930C
and PM-970C when used in color with three or four color mode, or with
grayscale in any mode other than two or seven color.
.IP 13
Works on certain printers that do not support 1440x720 DPI: Stylus
Photo (original), Stylus Color 440, 460, 480, Stylus C20SX, and Stylus

supported printers except for the Stylus Color, Stylus Color Pro, Pro
XL, 400, 440, 460, 480, 500, and 1500, and Stylus Photo.  In addition,
this may not work correctly on Stylus Color 1520 and Stylus Color
3000.
.IP 16
Works on printers that support 1440x720 DPI, but not any higher
resolution.  This includes the Stylus Color 580, 670 740, 760, 860,
900, and 1160, Stylus Photo EX, EX3, 700, 720, 750, 870, 875, 1200,

.IP 19
Works on Epson Stylus Photo 825, 830, and 925, and Stylus C61, C62,
C70, C80, C82.  This resolution is not listed by Epson, but
