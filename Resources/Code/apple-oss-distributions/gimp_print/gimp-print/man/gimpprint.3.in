.SH NAME
\fBgimpprint\fR \- High quality raster image printing library
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <gimp\-print/gimp\-print.h>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgimpprint\fR library routines give programmers an interface to print

vendor-supplied drivers in many cases, and can be used for many of the most
demanding printing tasks.
