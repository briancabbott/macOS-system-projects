We have found that glossy photo papers not specifically designed for Epson
printers generally perform poorly in Epson printers.  The ink tends to pool on
the paper, causing muddy shadows and possibly leaving ink on the printer
rollers.  Use of the highest quality printing modes (1440x720 highest quality
and 2880x720 unidirectional) produces the best result on such papers, probably
because printing is slower and there is more time for the ink to dry.
