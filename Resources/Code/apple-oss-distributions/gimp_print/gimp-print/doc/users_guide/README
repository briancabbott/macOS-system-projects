The files contained in this directory are all of the source files necessary
to build "The User's Guide to the Gimp-Print Top Quality Printer Drivers".

Type:  make pdf   - to build the PDF documentation file
       make ps    - to build the Postscript documentation file
       make html  - to build the HTML documentation files
       make docs  - to build all of the documentation files

This is what will be generated:

	users_guide.ps
	users_guide.pdf
	html/book1.html

While building the documentation, you will see messages from LaTeX regarding
undefined references.  These can also be safely ignored.

The documentation contains many color screenshots.  My goal was to have the
documentation print acceptably at 360 DPI.  However, I realize that not everybody
has a color printer.  For those people, such as the owners of laser printers,
I'd like to suggest printing the documentation in greyscale.  Printing the
documentation in black and white will results in unacceptable quality for many
of the screenshots.

All of the figures are contained in the "figures" subdirectory.  Read the
figures/README file if you are interested in how I created the
screenshots used throughout the documentation.

All of the HTML files are contained in the "html" subdirectory.

Your constructive feedback is most welcome.
