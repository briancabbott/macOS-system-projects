Here's how I created the screen dumps shown in the documentation
================================================================

0) Bring up the interesting window to be dumped

1) Bring up the GIMP

2) In the GIMP, select File...Acquire...ScreenShot

3) Click on the interesting window to be dumped

4) Select File...SaveAs, PNG, and the file name

The encapsulated postscript files are needed for generating the
final .ps file.  These are created from the PNG files using the
convert utility.  The PNG file is needed for the HTML output.

The image scaling is done in the DocBook source code contained in
users-guide.sgml
