    The Gimp-Print Top Quality Printer Drivers (hereafter
called Gimp-Print) are a set of printer drivers written to
take advantage of the full capabilities of a wide range of
printers. These drivers should work on any POSIX compliant operating
system (e.g. Linux, Solaris, IRIX, etc).  This document will explain how to
use the Gimp-Print software to achieve high quality printouts from the
<ulink url="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</ulink> (GNU Image
Manipulation Program) and
<ulink url="http://www.cups.org">CUPS</ulink> (Common Unix Printing
System).
  </para>
  <para>
    Please note that in addition to using the Gimp-Print software as a
print plugin for the GIMP, and as a set of printer drivers for CUPS, this
software can also be compiled and used with the 
<ulink url="http://www.ghostscript.com">Ghostscript</ulink> software
and with the 
<ulink
url="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html">Foomatic</ulink> 
software.
   </para>
   <para>
Regardless of whether the Gimp-Print software is used with the GIMP,
CUPS, Ghostscript, or Foomatic, the print quality and printer settings
remain the same.  However, use of the Gimp-Print with Ghostscript and
Foomatic is not covered in this document.  These topics may be covered
in a future revision of this document.
  </para>
  <para>
  This document corresponds to version 4.2.0 and later of the Gimp-Print
software. This document will serve as a guide to the user, and as such
will not explain how to install Gimp-Print, CUPS, GIMP, Ghostscript,
Foomatic, or any other related software.
