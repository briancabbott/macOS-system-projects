>CUPS must see the USB printer when the software starts.  The CUPS software
is typically started when the computer boots.  Note that one cannot
simply plug in the USB printer and power it on after CUPS has started.
(Note that this does not apply to parallel port printers).
   </P
><P
>If the USB printer was not connected and powered on at the time CUPS was
started, there will not be a USB printer shown in the
list of devices on the CUPS Admin Device Window (see 
<A
HREF="x452.html#FIG-CUPS-ADMIN-DEVICE"
>Figure 3-4</A
>).  In this event, stop the CUPS
software, properly connect and power on the USB printer, and restart
the CUPS software.
   </P
><P
>From the list of devices shown in the CUPS Admin Device Window
(see <A
HREF="x452.html#FIG-CUPS-ADMIN-DEVICE"
>Figure 3-4</A
>), a clever user might
attempt to avoid this issue by selecting 
<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Internet Printing Protocol</SPAN
> 
and then enter something similar to 'usb:/dev/usblp0' in the next
screen.  However, this fails later in the configuration process with a
"client_error_not_possible" error message with no other explanation.
Note that entering 'file:/dev/usblp0' will not work either. While CUPS
will allow this, printing will not actually work in some situations.
   </P
><P
>CUPS versions 1.1.10 and earlier exhibit similar behavior with regard
to not displaying the USB printer if it was not connected to the USB
bus and powered up prior to starting the CUPS software.  However,
these versions of CUPS will indeed allow the user to enter the name of
the USB connection, unlike versions 1.1.11 and later.

of the Gimp-Print revision for the driver, and ensure that it is
indeed the version of Gimp-Print which you have most recently
installed.  Once you have made the proper selection, click on the

It would probably be a good idea at this point to click on the

everything is working properly.  Take note of the Gimp-Print revision
printed on this screen and confirm once again that it is the expected
revision.
