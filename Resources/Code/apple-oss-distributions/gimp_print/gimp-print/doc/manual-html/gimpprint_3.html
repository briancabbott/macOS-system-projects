The GIMP-Print package is a collection of programs and a library for
high quality printing on modern inkjets, including `photographic
quality' models which offer very high resolutions and several inks.

META: Short history of the project

<P>
GIMP-Print is the print facility of the <STRONG>GNU Image Manipulation Program</STRONG>
(GIMP). It is in addition
a suite of drivers that may be used with common UNIX spooling systems
using GhostScript or CUPS.  These drivers provide printing quality for
UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in many
cases, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing tasks.
The core of GIMP-Print is a shared library (libgimpprint) which may be
used by any program that wishes to produce high-qulaity printed output.
