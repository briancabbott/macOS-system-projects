<H2><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="gimpprint_toc.html#TOC53">C.4  Appropriate Remote Commands</A></H2>

<P>
All of the remote commands described above are wrapped up with the usual
boilerplate.  The files always start with <SAMP>`00 00 00'</SAMP> and the
"magic" command described above, then two <SAMP>`ESC @'</SAMP>s to reset the
printer.  The remote command sequences come next; if they print anything
that is usually followed by a <SAMP>`FF'</SAMP> (0C hex) character to feed the
page, then the file ends with another two <SAMP>`ESC @'</SAMP>s to get back to
the ground state.

</P>
<P>
An alignment sequence goes like this:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>Host uses <SAMP>`DT'</SAMP> to print an alignment sheet

<LI>User eyeballs the sheet to see which is the best aligned pattern.

<LI>Host sends a <SAMP>`DA'</SAMP> command indicating which pattern the user chose

<LI>If the user said "realign", meaning he isn't done yet, go to step 1

<LI>We are done: host sends a <SAMP>`SV'</SAMP> command and exits

</OL>

<P>
The sequence used (by the STC 3000, at least) to print from the roll
feed is (with byte count omitted)

</P>

<PRE>
     PM 00 00
     SN 00 00 00
     EX 00 00 00 00 05 01
     ST 00 01
     SM 00 02
</PRE>

<P>
The sequence used by the STP 870 to print on plain paper is

</P>

<PRE>
     PM 00 00
     IR 00 03
     SN 00 00 01
     SN 00 01 00
     SN 00 02 01
     EX 00 00 00 00 05 00
     FP 00 00 00
</PRE>

<P>
and the job finishes with

</P>

<PRE>
     IR 00 02
     LD
</PRE>

<P>
For different paper type settings on the STP 870, the arguments to
<SAMP>`SN'</SAMP> vary.  The arguments to the first and third <SAMP>`SN'</SAMP> commands
are as outlined in the description of the <SAMP>`SN'</SAMP> command above; the
arguments to the second ("platen gap") are <SAMP>`00 01 01'</SAMP> for thick
papers ("matte paper--heavyweight", "photo paper" and "premium
glossy photo paper") and <SAMP>`00 01 00'</SAMP> for all others.

</P>
<P>
For roll-mode printing, the STP 870's sequence changes as follows.
<SAMP>`IR'</SAMP>'s arguments become <SAMP>`00 01'</SAMP> in the header, and <SAMP>`00
00'</SAMP> after the job, and <SAMP>`EX'</SAMP>'s last argument changes from <SAMP>`00'</SAMP>
to <SAMP>`01'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
For zero-margin printing on the STP 870, the arguments to <SAMP>`FP'</SAMP> become
<SAMP>`00 0xb0 0xff'</SAMP>.  This moves the origin about 5.5mm to the left, to a
point one tenth of an inch to the left of the left-hand edge of the
paper, allowing printing right up to (and beyond) the edge of the
paper.  Some printers (at least the STP 870) include white absorbent
pads at the left margin position and other positions (89mm and 100mm
on the STP 870) to soak up ink which misses the edge of the paper.
Printing off the edge of paper of a width not aligned with a pad could
result in making a mess of the inside of the printer and ink getting
on the reverse of the paper.
