<P>
This is a description of the ESC/P2 raster commands used by the
gimp-print plugin and Ghostscript driver, which is a subset of the
complete command set.  The full documents are found on
@url{http://www.ercipd.com/isv/edr_docs.htm}.  Note that these are
<STRONG>not</STRONG> always correct, and are certainly not complete.

</P>
<P>
All ESCP/2 raster commands begin with the <SAMP>`ESC'</SAMP> character (1b hex),
followed by either one or two command characters and arguments where
applicable.  Older commands generally have one command character.  Newer
commands usually have a <SAMP>`('</SAMP> (left parenthesis) followed by a
command character and a byte count for the arguments that follow.  The
byte count is a 16-bit (2 byte) binary integer, in little endian order.

</P>
<P>
All arguments listed here are of the form <SAMP>`name[bytes]'</SAMP> where
<SAMP>`[bytes]'</SAMP> is the number of bytes that comprise the argument.  The
arguments themselves are usually one, two, or four byte integers, always
little endian (the least significant bits come first).  Presumably this
is to match Intel processors.

</P>
<P>
In some cases, the same command sequence identifies different versions
of the same command, depending upon the number of bytes of arguments.
