The @command{automake} program can be used to generate <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> files
suitable for use with a <TT>`configure'</TT> script generated by
@command{autoconf}.  As @command{automake} <EM>requires</EM> @command{autoconf},
this section will assume the use of a <TT>`configure'</TT> script which uses the
<CODE>AM_PATH_GIMPPRINT</CODE> macro (there is little point in <EM>not</EM> using it!).

</P>
<P>
It is highly recommeded that you use GNU @command{autoconf} and
@command{automake}. They will allow you to make your software build on most
platforms with most compilers. @command{automake} makes writing complex
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> files very easy, by expressing how to build your packages
in terms of what files are required to build a project and the installation
locations of the files. It imposes a few limitations over using plain
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> files, such as in the use of conditionals, but these problems
are vastly outweighed by the benefits it brings. It also creates many extra
targets in the generated <TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> files such as @command{dist},
@command{distcheck}, @command{clean}, @command{distclean},
@command{maintainer-clean} and @command{tags}, and there are many more more
available. See Info file `automake', node `Top', for more information.

</P>
<P>
Because <CODE>AM_PATH_GIMPPRINT</CODE> calls <CODE>AC_SUBST</CODE> to substitute
@env{GIMPPRINT_CFLAGS}, @env{GIMPPRINT_LIBS} and @env{GIMPPRINT_CONFIG},
@command{automake} will automatically set these variables in the
<TT>`Makefile.in'</TT> files it generates, requiring no additional effort on
your part!

</P>
<P>
As in previous examples, we will make a program @command{prog} from a file <TT>`prog.c'</TT>. This is how one might build write a <TT>`Makefile.am'</TT> to do this:

</P>

<PRE>
AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = 1.4 gnu
MAINT_CHARSET = latin1

@SET_MAKE@

CFLAGS = @CFLAGS@

INCLUDES = @INCLUDES@ $(GIMPPRINT_CFLAGS)

bin_PROGRAMS = prog
prog_SOURCES = prog.c
prog_LDADD = $(GIMPPRINT_LIBS)

MAINTAINERCLEANFILES = Makefile.in
</PRE>

<P>
That's all there is to it! Please note that this example also requires the
macro <CODE>AC_PROG_MAKE_SET</CODE> to be used in <TT>`configure.in'</TT> and the use of
<CODE>AC_SUBST</CODE> to substitute @env{CFLAGS} and @env{INCLUDES} where
<CODE>@CFLAGS@</CODE> and <CODE>@INCLUDES@</CODE> are found in the file, respectively.
