@unnumbered Copying summary
GIMP-Print is @dfn{free}; this means that everyone is free to use it and
free to redistribute it on a free basis. GIMP-Print is not in the public
domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its
distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything
that a good cooperating citizen would want to do. What is not allowed is
to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of GIMP-Print
that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of GIMP-Print, that you receive source code or else can get it if
you want it, that you can change GIMP-Print or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute
copies of GIMP-Print, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for GIMP-Print. If GIMP-Print is modified
by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know that
what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
introduced by others will no reflect on our reputation.
