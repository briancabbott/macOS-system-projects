Title: The libgimpprint Reference Manual
Author: The Gimp-Print Project
Abstract: The gimpprint library routines give programmers an interface to
 print high quality bitmap images on most modern printers.  It includes drivers
 which provide printing quality for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary
 vendor-supplied drivers in many cases, and can be used for many of the most
 demanding printing tasks.  This manual covers developing programs that use
 libgimpprint for printing, as well as the concepts and internals of the
 library.
