Title: The libgimpprint API Reference Manual
Author: The Gimp-Print Project
Abstract: The gimpprint library routines give programmers an interface to
 print high quality bitmap images on most modern printers.  It includes drivers
 which provide printing quality for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary
 vendor-supplied drivers in many cases, and can be used for many of the most
 demanding printing tasks. This manual is a reference to the libgimpprint
 library.
