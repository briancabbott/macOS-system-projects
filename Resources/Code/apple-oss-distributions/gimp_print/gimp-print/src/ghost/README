INTRODUCTION:
-------------

  Gimp-Print includes a Ghostscript driver based on the IJS protocol.
  It requires GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or above, AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 or
  above, or ESP Ghostscript 7.05 or above.  IJS is an initiative to
  improve the quality and ease of use of printing with Ghostscript.
  It permits adding or upgrading drivers without recompiling
  Ghostscript.  An IJS driver runs in a separate process that
  communicates with Ghostscript via an IPC channel.  The Gimp-Print
  IJS driver may be used with AFPL Ghostscript, as it runs in a
  separate process.


AUTHOR:
-------

  The original Ghostscript stp driver was originally written by Henryk
  Richter (buggs@comlab.uni-rostock.de), and was integrated into
  Gimp-Print during the 3.1 development series.  Gimp-Print itself was
  originally written by Michael Sweet <mike@easysw.com>, who released
  up to version 2.0; Robert Krawitz released version 3.0.  The
  gimp-print development team (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) now
  maintains the entire package.

  The IJS driver was originally written by Russell Lang, and
  incorporated into Gimp-Print in early 2002.  This driver corresponds
  with the IJS protocol 0.32.

BUILD AND INSTALLATION OF THE IJS GIMPPRINT DRIVER:
----- --- ------------ -- --- --- --------- -------

   GNU Ghostscript 6.53 and beyond, and AFPL Ghostscript 7.04 and
   beyond, are required in order to use this driver.  These
   instructions correspond to GNU Ghostscript 6.53.

   You must first build Ghostscript itself with support for the IJS
   driver.  This is done as follows, within the Ghostscript source
   directory:

   cd ghostscript-6.53
   ./configure --with-ijs
   make
   make install

   The Ghostscript installation (as of 6.53, and likely 7.04) does not
   install certain files that are required to build the IJS driver.
   This should be fixed in future Ghostscript releases.  To build and
   install these files, you need to have the "aclocal", "autoconf",
   and "automake" packages installed.  These are not normally
   installed by default on most Linux and UNIX systems.  You may
   install them from your distribution, or download them from
   ftp.gnu.org.  After these packages are installed, run:

   cd ghostscript-6.53/ijs
   autoconf
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   You will perhaps get error messages during the autoconf process.
   The important point is that the configure works correctly.  This
   will install the necessary header files and libraries.

   After the IJS core files and Ghostscript are installed, you can
   build and install the IJS driver within the Gimp-Print package.
   This is done as follows, within the Gimp-Print source directory:

   ./configure --with-ghostscript
   make
   make install

   or

   ./configure --with-ghostscript --with-foomatic
   make
   make install

   if you also want to have the Foomatic data for the IJS driver
   (see the README file in the main directory of this package).

   If you do not wish to build the Gimp Print plugin, you may run

   ./configure --with-ghostscript --without-gimp

   ./configure --with-ghostscript --with-foomatic --without-gimp


OPTIONS:
--------

Overview
--------

Most of the Gimp-Print specific options are bundled together into a
single option that is passed in as a special "-sIjsParams" parameter,
and the normal Ghostscript "-s" and "-d" flags, indicating whether an
option is a string or a number, are not used in this special
parameter.

The device name is "ijs" (-sDEVICE=ijs).  In addition, the location of
the driver program must be specified.  This will typically be
/usr/local/bin/ijsgimpprint; the parameter in this case is
-sIjsServer=/usr/local/bin/ijsgimpprint .

Also, -dIjsUseOutputFD should be specified whenever output from
Ghostscript will go to stdout or into a pipe.  It may be specified in
all other cases, with only a slight performance degradation.

The -sIjsParams parameter contains a single string containing a
comma-separated list of sub-options:

-sIjsParams=Option1=Value1,Option2=Value2

and so forth.

The options for this driver are very complex. We strongly recommend
use of a printer management system such as Foomatic rather than
configuring a spooler manually with this driver. The driver name used
by Foomatic is "gimp-print-ijs".


Printer Model Selection:
------- ----- ----------

-sDeviceManufacturer=vendor -sDeviceModel=name

This option must be supplied.  There is no default.  The IJS driver
requires the vendor (it's part of the protocol), but the ijsgimpprint
driver ignores it.  It should be CANON, EPSON, LEXMARK, or
HEWLETT-PACKARD.

The list of available printers is quite long; the current complete
list is in the NEWS file at top level.  The Driver Name (e. g. pcl-2)
listed is the name that should be used.

Most or all of the Epson Stylus printers are fully functional.  The
others vary.  In particular, all of the listed Epson Stylus Photo
printers print in full 6-color photo mode; most of the others do not.
The color output has also been better tuned for Epson Stylus printers
than for others.


Print Resolution Selection:
----- ---------- ----------

-sIjsParams=Quality=quality

The meaning of this is model-specific.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sIjsParams=Quality, and the second (long) name is descriptive.  Each
printer has its own default value; for most printers, this is a
reasonable 300 or 360 DPI resolution.


For Epson Stylus printers:

*** Note: The driver resolution setting has been extensively
    overhauled in recent 4.3 releases.  The result is that all
    printers offer fewer choices of resolution.  In particular, the
    choice of unidirectional vs. bidirectional has been moved to a
    separate option, and the number of choices within each resolution
    (e. g. high quality and highest quality) has been reduced, so that
    only choices that give useful quality/printing speed tradeoffs
    have been retained.  For example, printers offering 1440x720 DPI
    generally do not offer 720 DPI Highest Quality.

    In Gimp-Print 4.2, very high resolutions generally offered
    significantly better linearization than lower resolutions on
    variable drop size printers, due to the way drop size computation
    and photo ink choices were made.  As of 4.3.15, results are much
    more uniform across resolutions, which may allow printing at a
    lower resolution in many cases.  In some cases, print quality at
    720 DPI may be very close to the quality achieved at 2880x1440
    DPI, with the only difference being slightly more microbanding at
    the lower resolution.  In other cases, the quality difference may
    be more noticeable, but not grossly so.

    Unlike typical OEM drivers, Gimp-Print allows any choice of
    resolution with any paper, so it is possible to select extremely
    high resolution with plain paper or very low resolution with high
    quality photo paper.  As a general rule of thumb, we suggest
    printing on plain paper at resolutions of 720 DPI or lower; on
    coated inkjet paper at 360 DPI to 1440x720 DPI; on high quality
    photo papers we recommend printing at resolutions not lower than
    720 DPI and for best quality using the highest resolution offered
    by the printer.

Within each specified resolution, the quality is generally listed from
worst to best (and generally higher quality means lower speed).
Characteristics of specific models and individual printers may affect
the orderings to some degree; on many printers, with certain papers,
unidirectional printing will improve quality substantially more than
using an otherwise better quality printing mode.

The difference between different quality settings lies in the number
of passes made over each line.  "High" and "Highest" quality settings
perform more passes, printing fewer dots with each pass over the same
line and using different nozzles for each pass.  This reduces banding
effects, but requires more time.

We generally recommend the following resolutions for the following
purposes.  The available Quality settings for each resolution are
described in the next section.

360x90    Fast economy draft output on plain paper (output will be very
360x120   banded and not very dark).

180       Economy draft output on plain paper (output will not be very
          dark, but with less banding than 360x90).  This resolution
          usually prints more slowly than 360x90, but renders in the
          same amount of time.

360x180   Draft output on plain paper (output will not be solidly
360x240   black); economy draft output on good quality inkjet paper.

360       Standard quality output on plain paper (output will be
          solidly black); draft output on good quality inkjet paper.

720x360   High quality output on plain paper; standard output on good
          quality inkjet paper.  On single drop size printers, this
          mode prints as fast as 360 DPI (but renders more slowly); it
          is often an excellent choice for plain paper.

720       Maximum quality on plain paper; high quality on good inkjet
          paper; proofs on photo-quality paper.  On many printers,
          there will be little difference between this and 720x360 on
          plain paper.  On older printers that do not offer 1440x720
          DPI, we recommend use of 720 DPI Highest Quality to minimize
          microbanding.

1440x720  Very high quality on good inkjet paper; high quality on
          photo paper; use 1440x720 Highest Quality to reduce
          microbanding if needed.  It usually offers little
          improvement over 720 DPI on plain paper.  On printers that
          do not offer 2880x720, we recommend use of 1440x720 Highest
          Quality to minimize microbanding.

2880x720  Highest quality on photo paper on many printers.  In most
	  cases, the quality improvement over 1440x720 DPI will be
	  modest, as generally the smallest droplet size is used at
	  both resolutions.

1440x1440 An unsupported mode offered on a few printers that offers
          higher quality than 2880x720 for certain types of images on
          very high quality paper.  It does not appear to offer any
          advantage on smooth tones, but fine detail (particularly
          vertical, and to a lesser extent near-horizontal) it shows
          noticeable improvement.  It takes as long to print as
          2880x720.

2880x1440 Highest quality on photo paper on the Epson Stylus Photo
	  950/960/PM-950C (2 picolitre drops) and Epson Stylus Photo
	  2100/2200 and Stylus Pro 7600 and 9600 (4 picolitre
	  UltraChrome ink drops).

2880x2880 Highest quality on glossy photo papers on the Epson PM-930C
	  and PM-970C (1.8 picolitre drops).


The following Quality settings are supported on printers other than
the Stylus Pro (5000, 5500, 7000, 7500, 9000, 9500, and 10000)
printers.  Quality settings for those printers are listed in a later

Ink Types
--- -----

This is printer type specific.  The option names are case sensitive.
The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sIjsParams=InkType, and the second (long) name is descriptive.  Not
all ink types are supported on all printers.

-sIjsParams=InkType=inktype


For Epson and Lexmark (other than the 4076) printers:

Six color printers can print using four color inks or all six colors.
Six color mode is recommended for photographs.  Four color mode may be
useful when printing text with embedded graphics to reduce ink
consumption, or to print higher quality with Ordered, Fast, or Very
Fast dithering (see below).

The "Composite" modes use only color inks (no black) to produce all
colors and black.  These ink types are rarely useful, but on certain
types of paper they may produce a smoother image than that produced by
mixing black ink in.  The Epson Stylus Color 1500 cannot mix black ink
with colored inks; on this printer, Three Color Composite must be
used.

We have found that glossy photo papers not specifically designed for
Epson printers generally perform poorly in Epson printers.  The ink
tends to pool on the paper, causing muddy shadows and possibly leaving
ink on the printer rollers.  Use of the highest quality printing modes
(1440x720 highest quality and 2880x720 unidirectional) produces the
best result on such papers, probably because printing is slower and
there is more time for the ink to dry.

Media Sizes
----- -----

This is printer-specific; we cannot list the correct values for each
printer here.  The option names are case-sensitive.  Two names are
listed for each resolution; the first (short) name is the value that
must be passed to -sPAPERSIZE, and the second (long) name is
descriptive.  This option does not set GhostScript up to use a paper
size other than the default; it only tells the driver to set up the
printer for a different paper size.  The default paper size is
'Letter'.

-sPAPERSIZE=papersize (for known Ghostscript paper sizes)
  or
-dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=x -dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=y
               where x and y are the width and height of the paper

Color Balancing Values: (min,max,default)
----- --------- ------- -----------------

All of the values below are interpreted as being relative to norms for
a particular printer established through testing, not "absolute"
values of any kind.

-sIjsParams=Cyan=xxx       xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)
-sIjsParams=Magenta=xxx    xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)
-sIjsParams=Yellow=xxx     xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 These three options allow specification of the cyan, magenta, and
 yellow levels independently, for rebalancing the levels.  Normally,
 these should be adjusted to yield neutral gray, but they can be used
 for other effects.

-sIjsParams=Brightness=xxx xxx: 0.0 ... 2.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the brightness of the image.  0.0 gives a fully black image;
 2.0 gives a fully white image.  Values greater than 1 will result in
 black not being solid and highlights turning white; values less than
 1 will result in white not being perfectly clear and shadows turning
 black.

-sIjsParams=Contrast=xxx   xxx: 0.0 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the contrast of the image.  0.0 gives a solid gray for the
 entire image, the exact gray depending upon the brightness chosen.

-sIjsParams=Gamma=xxx      xxx: 0.1 ... 4.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the gamma of the image, over and above the printer-specific
 correction.  Gamma less than 1.0 will result in a darker image; gamma
 greater than 1.0 will result in a lighter image.  Unlike brightness,
 gamma adjustment does not change the endpoints; it merely changes the
 shape of the input->output curve.

-sIjsParams=Density=xxx    xxx: 0.1 ... 2.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the amount of ink deposited on the paper.  If you've chosen
 the correct paper type and you're getting ink bleeding through the
 paper or puddling, try reducing the density to the lowest value you
 can while still achieving solid black.  If you're not getting solid
 black, even with the contrast and brightness at 1.0, try increasing
 the density.

 All of the printers supported here actually need less than 100% ink
 density in most cases, so the actual density is something other than
 the nominal density setting.  The effective density setting cannot go
 above 100%, so if a value specified will result in an excessively
 high density level, it will be silently limited to 1.0.

-sIjsParams=Saturation=xxx xxx: 0.0 ... 9.0  (1.0)

 Adjust the brilliance of colors.  0.0 results in pure grayscale;
 using this with -sProcessColorModel=DeviceRGB is one way of getting
 grayscale (see below under Output Type for a full discussion).
 Saturation of less than 1.0 results in more muted colors; saturation
 of greater than 1.0 results in more vibrant colors.  Very high
 saturation often results in very strange effects, including
 posterization and banding that might not be expected.  For normal
 purposes, the saturation should generally be less than 1.5.


Dithering Algorithms:
--------- -----------

The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each
resolution; the first (short) name is the value that must be passed to
-sIjsParams=DitherAlgorithm, and the second (long) name is descriptive.

IJS: -sIjsParams=DitherAlgorithm=algorithm

Adaptive        Adaptive Hybrid
EvenTone        EvenTone screening (experimental)
Ordered         Ordered
Fast            Fast
VeryFast        Very Fast
Floyd           Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg

For highest quality, we recommend use of Adaptive Hybrid dithering.
For continuous tone images, Ordered works just as well and is somewhat
faster.  Ordered dithering yields noticeably inferior results with
text and intricate line art, particularly at high resolutions.

EvenTone dithering is a relatively new screening technology developed
by Raph Levien.  It offers superior smoothness in highlights and
midtones, and increased accuracy in shadows, resulting in
significantly improved results overall.  The version of EvenTone
dithering that we are using is enhanced with some additional
improvements we have made.  It currently only operates with CMYK (4,
6, or 7 color output) with RGB input, and should be considered
experimental.  Note that it is patented (see US patent 5917614), but
it is licensed for use with GPL software.  See
http://www.levien.com/patents.html for more information.

Fast dithering, which is a simplified version of ordered dither, is
significantly faster, but color accuracy is worse, particularly on six
color printers and printer using variable dot sizes.  On simple four
color printers, the quality is quite reasonable, although color
printing will show more speckling in dark tones than Ordered dither.
For single dot size printers, printing grayscale, this algorithm
yields almost identical results to Ordered with some performance
improvement.  On three color printers, the results should be very
similar to Ordered.

Very Fast is even faster than Fast, with even more loss of quality.
It shows even more speckling, and the output is heavily patterned.  On
laser printers, and possibly on certain kinds of text and line art,
Very Fast dithering may actually yield the best quality.

Error diffusion algorithms (Hybrid Floyd-Steinberg is such an
algorithm) perform very well at high densities, and are capable of
rendering very fine detail well, but they tend to exhibit artifacts in
the form of "waves" or "worms" of dots which results in noticeable
texturing in pale areas.  Furthermore, pale areas immediately adjacent
to white take a while to "build up" sufficient error to print at all.
This is sometimes called "tearing".  Its use is not recommended.


Output Type
------ ----

Black and white: -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray -dBitsPerSample=1
Grayscale:       -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray
Color (RGB):     -sProcessColorModel=DeviceRGB
Color (CMYK):    -sProcessColorModel=DeviceCMYK

 Choose color vs. grayscale output.  Color output is the default.
 Choosing -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray results in only black ink (no
 color ink) being used, which is faster and usually results in the
 most accurate grayscale, but at the expense of smoothness.  If you
 want composite color (using a mixture of color and black inks to
 produce gray), use --sProcessColorModel=DeviceRGB and
 -sIjsParams=Saturation=0.0 (see -sIjsParams=Saturation above).

 In addition, using -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray uses luminance
 (perceived brightness) of red, green, and blue to choose output
 levels.  Blue of a given intensity is perceived to be much darker
 than red, which in turn appears darker than green.
 -sProcessColorModel=DeviceRGB and -sIjsParams=Saturation=0.0 does not
 use luminance.

 -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray -dBitsPerSample=1 prints only black
 and white (thresholding).  This option always uses Fast dithering
 unless you specify Very Fast.

 -sProcessColorModel=DeviceCMYK is useful if you're printing a CMYK
 graphic and want explicit control over the inks.  Generally it yields
 inferior quality, as Gimp-Print has good algorithms for converting
 RGB (screen) into CMYK (inks) that take into account paper type, ink
 type, and other variables.  In CMYK mode, the brightness, contrast,
 and saturation controls do not function.


Image type (to optimize the dither):
----- ---- --- -------- --- --------

-sIjsParams=ImageOptimization=x

Select the image type most representative of what's being printed.

LineArt     Line art (color or gray scale)
Solid       Primarily solid colors or smooth gradients (color or gray scale)
Photograph  Continuous-tone photographs (color or gray scale)

LineArt is the fastest.  It generates strong, but not particularly
accurate, colors.  There may be some fairly sharp color transitions in
this mode.

Solid generates more accurate colors, but is slower.

Photograph generates the most accurate colors, but is considerably
slower.

Note that any of the modes may be used with either color or black &
white output.  If black and white output is requested, but a color
mode used, composite color will be printed.  This generally offers
smoother tone, but less purity of gray or black, than pure black ink.
Furthermore, it is possible to tune the color of the gray (to achieve
warmer or cooler effects) using the color controls in this fashion.

Specifying a lower GhostScript resolution (with -r) results in faster
color conversion.  For example, if you print at 1440x720 DPI, but
specify a Ghostscript resolution of 360 DPI (with -r360), output will
be significantly faster and there will be much less difference in
performance between the three image type options.


EXAMPLES:
---------

Note that a lot of these options are used for demonstration; generally
adjusting the density is a bad idea.  Also, replace
"/usr/local/bin/ijsgimpprint" with the location where ijsgimpprint is
installed on your system.

Example 1 (print charts to file, using A4 paper, color, 360 dpi):
gs -sDEVICE=ijs -sIjsServer=/usr/local/bin/ijsgimpprint \
   -sDeviceManufacturer=EPSON -sDeviceModel=escp2-ex -sPAPERSIZE=a4 \
   -sOutputFile=itsyourchoice.prn \
   -sIjsParams=Density=1.6,Gamma=1.5,Saturation=0.9,Brightness=0.4,ImageOptimization=Solid \
   foo.ps

Example 2 (print color photograph to /dev/lp0 at maximum quality):
gs -sDEVICE=ijs -sIjsServer=/usr/local/bin/ijsgimpprint \
   -sDeviceManufacturer=EPSON -sDeviceModel=escp2-870 \
   -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 \
   -sIjsParams='Quality=1440x720hq,MediaType=GlossyPhoto,Density=0.8,ImageOptimization=Photograph' \
   foo.ps

Example 3 (print pure black text to stdout)
gs -sDEVICE=ijs -sIjsServer=/usr/local/bin/ijsgimpprint \
   -sDeviceManufacturer=EPSON -sDeviceModel=escp2-660 -dIjsUseOutputFD \
   -sProcessColorModel=DeviceGray -dBitsPerSample=1 -sOutputFile=- \
   -sIjsParams='Quality=720sw,Density=0.8' foo.ps
