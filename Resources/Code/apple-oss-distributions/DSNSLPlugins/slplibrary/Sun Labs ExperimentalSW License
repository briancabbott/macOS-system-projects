The library allows a networked host to issue structured queries and dynamically discover arbitrar\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 y network services. The mslpd service allows arbitrary services on a network host to be advertised so that they can be discovered by clients using the mslplib. The network protocol used by these components is the "Service Location Protocol Version 2". Thi\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 s\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4  protocol is a proposed standard issued by the IETF.
