To build Wget with VC++ 5.0 run configure.bat in the wget directory,
and then run nmake.  If you want to build the help file you will need
a copy of makinfo to convert wget.texi to rtf. I've made a copy
available at <URL:http://www.sunsite.auc.dk/wget/makeinfo.zip>.  This
copy of makeinfo is from the miktxt 1.10 archive available from ctan.
