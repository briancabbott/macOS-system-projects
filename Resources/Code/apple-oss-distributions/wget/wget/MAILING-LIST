                          Mailing List Info


Thanks to Karsten Thygesen, Wget has its own mailing list for
discussion and announcements.  The list address is hosted at Sunsite
Denmark, <wget@sunsite.auc.dk>.  To subscribe, send mail to
<wget-subscribe@sunsite.auc.dk>.

The list is fairly low-volume -- one or two messages per day and with
sporadic periods of intensive activity.  If you are interested in
using or hacking Wget, or wish to read the important announcements,
you are very welcome to subscribe.

The list is archived at <URL:http://fly.cc.fer.hr/archive/wget>.
