The current version of cracklib is 2.7. These sources can be found at Alec Muffett's homepage:

    http://www.crypticide.org/users/alecm/.
    
The sources compile as is on Jaguar and OS X, and we include the dictionaries, 
which are part of Crack 5.0. The dictionaries will be located at: 

	/usr/local/lib/pw_dict.pwd
	/usr/local/lib/pw_dict.pwi
	/usr/local/lib/pw_dict.hwm

and the library is installed by default into /usr/local/libdata/cracklib

The libcrack.h is also from the Crack 5.0 distribution.
