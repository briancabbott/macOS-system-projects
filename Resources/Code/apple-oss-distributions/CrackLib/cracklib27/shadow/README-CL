Hi,

This here's a patch for John F Haugh's "shadow" password program, to get
it using "CrackLib".  I'm afraid I haven't had much opportunity to test
it (I don't have the time or resources), but I'd like to know how you
get on using it.

Instructions:

    1) Read the docs. Build and install CrackLib.

    2) Install the latest version of "shadow" (patchlevel 6)
     - available from comp.sources.misc archives everywhere.

    It's spattered amongst several directories (being a initial
    distribution, + patches), so you'll need the contents of:

	usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume26/shadow
	usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume28/shadow
	usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume29/shadow
	usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume30/shadow
	usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume32/shadow

    3) Install the enclosed file as "obscure.c" - it's only a
       trivial change, you might like to hack it a bit yourself.

    4) Edit the new "obscure.c" to change the value of:

	CRACKLIB_DICTPATH

       - to whatever you used during the CrackLib installation

    5) Change the "shadow" Makefile to that shadow will be linked
       with CrackLib, eg:

    change:

	LIBS = -lcrypt -lndbm

    to:

	LIBS = /where/ever/cracklib/cracklib.a -lcrypt -lndbm

    6) Build and install "shadow"

    7) Make sure you have obscure checks enabled

    8) Run with it.
