CrackLib is a library containing a C function (well, lots of functions
really, but you only need to use one of them) which may be used in a
"passwd"-like program.

The idea is simple: try to prevent users from choosing passwords that
could be guessed by "Crack" by filtering them out, at source.

CrackLib is an offshoot of the the version 5 "Crack" software, and
contains a considerable number of ideas nicked from the new software. 
At the time of writing, Crack 5 is incomplete (still awaiting purchase
of my home box) - but I though I could share this with you. 

NOTE THIS WELL: CrackLib is NOT a replacement "passwd" program. 
CrackLib is a LIBRARY.  CrackLib is what trendy marketdroid types would
probably call an "enabler". 

The idea is that you wire it into your _own_ "passwd" program (if you
have source); alternatively, you wire it into something like "shadow"
from off of the net.  You can use it almost _everywhere_. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION:

CrackLib has been tested mostly on Suns.  If you can point me at ways
round portability problems (eg: static linking, other libraries, etc)
I'd be most grateful.
