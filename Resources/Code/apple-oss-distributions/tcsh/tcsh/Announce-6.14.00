Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.14 is now available; this version
fixes a number of bugs and adds the following enhancements:

New Features:
    * UTF-8 handling for both singe and double width characters
    * termname builtin for testing whether a terminal type is
      available in termcap/terminfo

Bug Fixes:
    * too many to enumerate here, consult the Fixes file

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga...
