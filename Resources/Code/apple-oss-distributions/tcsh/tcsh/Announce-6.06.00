Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.06 is finally available.

- NLS Message Catalog support.
- Many bug fixes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, and it compiles
and is very close to working on OS/2 EMX.

You can get tcsh from tesla.ee.cornell.edu:/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.06.tar.gz
This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you
can get it from prep.ai.mit.edu or other GNU mirrors, or ask tesla to
unpack it on the fly using 'get tcsh-6.06.tar'.

For the DNS impaired: tesla.ee.cornell.edu == 128.84.253.11

I would like to thank:

    o the Cornell EE Department for giving tcsh a home for the past 8 years.
    o everyone who sent bug reports
    o the beta test team and specially:

      Paul DuBois <dubois@primate.wisc.ed>
	For testing every little feature mentioned in the manual page
	and finding lots of bugs and inconsistencies.
      Michael Schmidt <michael@muc.de>
	For providing the initial implementation of the NLS catalog stuff.
      Michael Schroeder <mlschroe@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
	For insisting that I was wrong and there was indeed a bug...
      Dave Schweisguth <dcs@proton.chem.yale.edu>
	For continuously trying to keep the manual page up-to-date.
      Bruce Sterling Woodcock <bsw@netcom.com>
	For cleaning up the code after the latest storm of patches.
