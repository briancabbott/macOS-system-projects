I think this is a good workflow:

- new bug reported
- before working on it, please assign it to yourself (to avoid more than
  one person working on it):
  a) view the issue and click Assign To: while the dropdown shows [Myself]
     or your username
  b) use the checkboxes on the View Issues page and select the Assign
     action and click OK (haven't gone this route myself yet)
- work on the code, commit to CVS, use the magic words "issue #NNNN" in
  the commit message; the commit message will get the status changed to
  confirmed; if you didn't remember to use the magic words, don't worry,
  just continue with the next step
- go to the View Issues page, use the checkbox(es) to select the issue(s)
  you have resolved, select the Resolve action and click OK
- set the Resolution field accordingly (usually "fixed", if you committed
  code for the issue) and select the Fixed in Version (IMPORTANT)

Of course, only the "fixed" resolution warrants selecting a version.

Before resolving to anything but "fixed", you should probably attach a new
note explaining why you are setting a specific resolution.
