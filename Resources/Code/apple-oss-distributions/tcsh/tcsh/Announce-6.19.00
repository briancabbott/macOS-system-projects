Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.19 is now available; this is a mainly a
bug fix release (after 3 years) with few new features:

	1. new cdtohome variable
	2. locking in history files
	3. history speedups.

Please consult the Fixes files for a complete list of changes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga...

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.19.00.tar.gz

RMD160 (tcsh-6.19.00.tar.gz) = 0f1e8c5fdee634baff6670290bd30074db965da3

This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you can
get it from ftp.gnu.org or other GNU mirrors.

I would like to thank:

    * everyone who sent bug reports
    * the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions
