Hello,

Tcsh-6.00.03 is now available from tesla.ee.cornell.edu. 
				   [128.84.253.11,128.84.224.11]

Tcsh 6.00.03 now supports SVR4 machines (David Dawes),
has a full vi editor (Jose Souza), 
has emacs i-search functions (Per Hederland), 
supports imake (Marc Horowitz),
and can accept csh constructs in aliases.

I wish to thank all the people who beta tested this version and their
users who suffered through it...

The whole distribution is in /pub/tcsh-6.00/tcsh-6.00.03.tar.Z
A patch from 6.00.02 to 6.00.03 is also available in
/pub/tcsh-6.00/tcsh-6.00.02-6.00.03.patch.Z, but it is 200K, so you might
be better off getting the whole thing.

christos
