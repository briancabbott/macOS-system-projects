Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.12 is now available; this version
fixes a lot of bugs and adds the following enhancements:

New Features:
	* %j in prompt
	* utf8 support

New Ports:
	* darwin support

Locale Support:
	* russian locale fixes
	* polish locale fixes

Bug Fixes:
	* too many to enumerate here, consult the fixes file

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga

You can get tcsh from ftp.astron.com:/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.12.tar.gz
This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you
can get it from ftp.gnu.org or other GNU mirrors, or ask ftpd to
unpack it on the fly using 'get tcsh-6.12.tar'.

I would like to thank:

    o everyone who sent bug reports
    o the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions

christos
