Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.18 is now available; this is a mainly a
bug fix release with few new features:

	1. new autorehash builtin to control how the internal command hash 
	   table is maintained.
	2. globstar globbing to allow ** and *** expansions
	3. euid, euser, egid variables.
	4. wait built-in is now interruptible
	5. new anyerror variable to control error handling in pipelines

Please consult the Fixes files for a complete list of changes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga...

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.18.00.tar.gz
