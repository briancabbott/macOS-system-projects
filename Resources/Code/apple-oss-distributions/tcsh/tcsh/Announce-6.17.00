Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.17 is now available; this is a mainly a
bug fix release with the exception of these three feature additions:


 10. always save the whole command, not just the first 80 chars of it.
  4. Add autoexpand=onlyhistory (Don Estabrook, m66)
  3. Add history in loops (Laurence Darby, m48)

Please consult the Fixes files for a complete list of changes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga...

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.17.00.tar.gz

I would like to thank:
