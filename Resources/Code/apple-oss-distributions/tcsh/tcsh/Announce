Hello everyone,

This is the release announcement of tcsh version 6.00.  Tcsh is a
version of the Berkeley C-Shell, with the addition of: a command line
editor, command and file name completion, listing, etc. and a bunch of
small additions to the shell itself.

Tcsh can now be distributed in full under the Berkeley Copywrite
Agreement.  I wish to thank Keith Bostic at Berkeley for all the help
in freeing the sources of most unix utilities for 4.4BSD.

I also wish to thank the people from all around the world :-), who
helped the beta testing, and followed all 28 patches of tcsh-5.99!

You should be able to compile and run tcsh in most popular unix machines,
and with a bit of tinkering it should run on anything that calls itself *ix.

You can grab a copy of tcsh, from tesla.ee.cornell.edu:/pub/tcsh-6.00.tar.Z.

Have fun, 

christos
