Hello again,

Tcsh-6.00.02 is now available from tesla.ee.cornell.edu. A couple of
globbing bugs have been fixed, and a few enhancements have been added:


V6.00.02, 08/05/91
8.  tcsh will always set $LOGNAME and $USER if not already set in the
    environment.
7.  added $histfile.
6.  echo `echo` * and  echo ~ {} were broken
5.  setty builtin addition
4.  Multiple : modifiers [experimental, disabled with -DCOMPAT]
3.  7 bit fixes, and hp9000s500.
2.  #undef DEBUG in tc.alloc.c, so we continue if we get a bad free() 
1.  getn() is now protected against NULL strings.

You can get the whole distribution (/pub/tcsh-6.00/tcsh-6.00.02.tar.Z) 
or a patch from 6.00.01 to 6.00.02 (/pub/tcsh-6.00/tcsh-6.00.01-6.00.02.patch.Z)
