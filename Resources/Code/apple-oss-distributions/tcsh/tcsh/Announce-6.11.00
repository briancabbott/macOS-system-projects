Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga

You can get tcsh from ftp.astron.com:/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.11.tar.gz
This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you
can get it from ftp.gnu.org or other GNU mirrors, or ask ftpd to
unpack it on the fly using 'get tcsh-6.11.tar'.

I would like to thank:

    o everyone who sent bug reports
    o the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions

christos
