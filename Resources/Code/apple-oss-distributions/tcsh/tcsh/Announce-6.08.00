Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.08 is finally available; this version
fixes a lot of bugs and adds the following enhancements:

	* Windows/NT support.			Amol Deshpande
	* Autoconf support.			Kaveh Ghazi
	* More NLS message catalogs.		(various)
	* color-ls builtin.			Taga Nayuta
	* support for right side prompt.	Luke Mewburn
	* EBCDIC port.				Martin Kraemer
	* wide-char display support.		Yoshiyuki Sakakibara

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32.

You can get tcsh from ftp.astron.com:/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.08.tar.gz
This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you
can get it from prep.ai.mit.edu or other GNU mirrors, or ask ftp to
unpack it on the fly using 'get tcsh-6.08.tar'.

I would like to thank:

    o everyone who sent bug reports
    o the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions
