Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.05 is finally available.

- New manual page
- New html manual
- New environment variables OSTYPE VENDOR MACHTYPE REMOTEHOST
- New pathname completions
- New hup builtin
- New filetest builtin and file operators
- New $histdup variable to eliminate duplicate history entries.
- New scheduled events formatting.

- Old bind, aliases and and other obsolete builtins removed.

And as always:

- Many, many, many bug fixes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, and it compiles
and is very close to working on OS/2 EMX.

You can get tcsh from tesla.ee.cornell.edu:/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.05.tar.gz
This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you
can get it from prep.ai.mit.edu or other GNU mirrors, or ask tesla to
unpack it on the fly using 'get tcsh-6.05.tar'.

For the DNS impaired: tesla.ee.cornell.edu == 128.84.253.11

I would like to thank:

    o the Cornell EE Department for giving tcsh a home for the past 7 years.
    o everyone who sent bug reports
    o the beta testers who survived all 17 beta releases
    o and the following contributors:

	Bruce Sterling 		- most code enhancements and cleanups
	Dave Schweisguth	- new man page and html filter
	Michael Schroeder	- rewrote the routine from hell [bgetc()]

christos
