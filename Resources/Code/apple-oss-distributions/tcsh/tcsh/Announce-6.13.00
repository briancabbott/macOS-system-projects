Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.13 is now available; this version
fixes a number of bugs and adds the following enhancements:

New Features:
	* turn on kanji and dspmbyte by default

Bug Fixes:
	* too many to enumerate here, consult the fixes file

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga...

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.13.00.tar.gz

I would like to thank:

+ Kim
