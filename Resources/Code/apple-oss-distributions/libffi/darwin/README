These header files potentially need to be updated whenever we update to a newer version of upstream libffi.

Running the generate-darwin-source-and-headers.py script in the parent directory will create the updated headers
in darwin_ios/include and darwin_osx/include.  Replace the headers in darwin/include with newer copies of those
headers.

fficonfig*.h don't get installed, so just copy the _arch.h versions in place.  You'll need to hand edit fficonfig.h's
handling of arm64 and arm64e.

ffitarget*.h are customized per architecture, so just copy the _arch.h versions in place.  Note that i386 and
x86_64 are the same, so just squash them.  Also notice that the arm64e version is not needed, so remove it and
edit ffitarget.h.  You will also need to edit ffitarget_*.h to disable FFI_GO_CLOSURES and re-add
FFI_LEGACY_CLOSURE_API.

The only difference between the ffi_*.h are in the architecture definition macros, so it's easiest to just
hand craft those as necessary.  It's actually probably easier to compare the differences in ffi.h.in between
versions and applying that to our ffi.h.

Don't forget to add availability markup as needed.
