+Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest repository versions to your
+working sources.  The tags are applied immediately to the repository, as with
+\fBrtag\fR, but the versions are supplied implicitly by the CVS records of your
+working files' history rather than applied explicitly.
+.SP
+One use for tags is to record a snapshot of the current sources when the software
+freeze date of a project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after the freeze date, only
+those changed sources that are to be part of the release need be re-tagged.
+.SP
+The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which revisions of which files were
+used in creating a software distribution.  The \fBcheckout\fR and \fBupdate\fR
+commands allow you to extract an exact copy of a tagged release at any time in the
+future, regardless of whether files have been changed, added, or removed since the
+release was tagged.
+.SP
+This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag, or to create a branch.

+Delete a tag.
+.SP
+If you use \fBcvs tag -d symbolic_tag\fR, the symbolic tag you specify is deleted
+instead of being added.  Warning: Be very certain of your ground before you delete
+a tag; doing this effectively discards some historical information, which may later
+turn out to have been valuable.
