2007-12-05  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Remove -Wno-long-double from Makefile, it is not supported
	by gcc-4.2.
	
2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (check): Use the new check command from TOT.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Don't error out if chgrp procmod 
	fails.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Fix typeo in last change.

2007-03-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Don't check whoami(1) output before
	doing chmod.  This file is run as root.

2006-04-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Take out all the cross debugger building, the
	framework creation, the installhdrs phase and only install
	a fat /usr/libexec/gdb/gdb-for-codewarrior binary.

2005-12-01  Ronnie Misra (rgmisra@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Update to recognize new translate program path/command
	line parameter.

2005-11-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add command line parameter when invoking Rosetta.

2005-10-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Copy DYLD_* into GDB_DYLD_* to get past the setgid barrier.

2005-09-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: make the gdb binaries setgid procmod.

2005-05-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Update --help text.

2005-05-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Remove.
	* Makefile: Don't install cache-symfiles.sh.

2005-05-03  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add --oah750 command line option.

2005-04-14  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add a -arch command line option.

2005-01-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Update to the last merge.

2004-12-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Info-template.plist: It looks like CFBundleDevelopmentRegion needs
	to be defined; whatever.  Looking at two installed frameworks I see 
	English is an acceptable setting, so there we go.  These are just 
	private framework header files used for building gdb plug-ins anyway.

2004-08-09  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Post-process the man page to refer to
	$(SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR) instead of hard-coding (see
	change to gdb/gdb.1).

2004-06-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* ntbuild.sh, ntconfig.sh: Removed.
	* dpkg/control: Removed.
	* ChangeLog.binutils: Removed.

2004-06-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Don't install binutils, unnecessary frameworks.
	Don't create /usr/lib, /usr/libexec/binutils directories.

2004-06-11  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Quote documentation directory pathnames in case
	a space character is added.

2004-06-08  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

        * cache-symfiles.sh: For now, don't emit cached symfiles
        if the original library has any stabs.  gdb crashes when
        these are present (Radar 3418798)
        Also deleted the setting of "name" in the second (library)
        search, since we don't actually use it.
	Also, run the script far enough to delete the old symfile
	directory, since then gdb won't bother to look at a bunch
	of symfiles which it surely can't use.
	
2004-06-08  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): Set from
	pb_makefiles' plaform-variables.make if possible. 

2004-06-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Move GDB_RC_VERSION up where I can see it.
	(SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): New variable to hold the location
	of the installed documentation, cf r. 3678942.
	(install-binutils-common): Don't install binutils docs.
	(install-binutils-macosx): Don't install binutils docs.
	(install-chmod-macosx): Update chmod call to avoid deprecation warning.

2004-05-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Bump GDB_RC_VERSION to new range.

2004-05-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* cached-symfiles.sh: Suppress cacheing of symfiles until Klee
	has a chance to make it work again in the newly merged sources.

2003-10-03  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * cache-symfiles.sh: Run nm on dylibs to ensure they're well formed
        before feeding them to gdb.

2003-07-24  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Use the proper prefix for dyld; no longer
	remove the dyld.syms from the cached symfile directory.

2003-05-04  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Use GDB_RC_VERSION instead of APPLE_VERSION in the
	gdb.sh target.  Use GDB_FRAMEWORKS and BINUTILS_FRAMEWORKS instead
	of FRAMEWORKS in the install target.

2003-05-04  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Use the correct path to GDB.  Don't read the
	user's .gdbinit.  Check for dangling symlinks in /usr/lib.

2003-04-24  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Don't chmod the dylds if you aren't doing 
	--enable-shared.
	Also change the version string to 268.
	
2003-04-25  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Update to use the new cached-symfile
	creation commands.

2003-03-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Updated date string to most recent
	merge.
	(CONFIG_OTHER_OPTIONS): Add --disable-serial-configure.  Not
	exactly sure what is up with this, but buildit fails without
	it -- somehow configure-liberty is being triggered from the
	"configure-gdb" target and the build fails because libiberty
	isn't included in the sources.

2003-01-14  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Update to use the top-level configure, and then run
	make configure-gdb.  Build intl and readline for each
	cross-compiled platform, rather than re-using the native build.
	
2002-12-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Test each potential framework for validity,
	rather than by using an explicit list of invalid framework.
	* configure: Update to configure the needed subdirectories (they
	are no longer automatically configured by the top-level
	configure).  Remove __objcInit removal code (it's removed by the
	GDB makefile).
	
2002-10-28  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Remove PDO support.  Convert "rhapsody" to "macosx".
	Remove obsolete Mac OS X release names.  Use *-apple-darwin
	instead of *-apple-macos10 as the primary build string.  Remove
	WITH_CFM and WITH_PTHREADS options.  Pass location for
	libintl.dylib.
	* gdb.sh: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.
	* template.h: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.  Remove
	Rhapsody support.
	* macsbug/Makefile: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.
	* macsbug/build.sh: Remove.
	
2002-09-24  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Update version number.
	* Makefile: Add *-macosx-darwin to the list of recognized arch strings.
	* Makefile: Strip trailing and leading spaces from CFLAGS.

	* template.h: include machine/sys--sys/file, not sys--sys/file.
