	* configure.in (target==*darwin*): Don't configure/build tcl/expect;
	we hae perfectly good versions in /usr/bin already.
	Don't configure utils, sim, etc.  We don't use them so it's just wasted
	time.

2004-03-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile.in: Use "GAS_FOR_TARGET" instead of "AS_FOR_TARGET" - 
	autoconf 2.57 seems to not like "AS_FOR_TARGET" as a special name.
	* Makefile.tpl: Ditto.
	* configure.in:  Use "host", "build", "target" instead of
	"host_alias", "build_alias", "target_alias".  I believe this is an
	autoconf 2.13 vs autoconf 2.57 difference, although I haven't
	investigated in depth.
	Configure bfd, binutils, opcodes, gdb directories on darwin systems.
	Default to --disable-shared --enable-64-bit-bfd --disable-softfloat.
	Use "GAS_FOR_TARGET" instead of "AS_FOR_TARGET" - autoconf 2.57 seems 
	to not like "AS_FOR_TARGET" as a special name.
	* gettext.m4: Link directly to libintl.a, not libintl.la.

2003-02-27  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* defs.h (gdb_osabi): Add support for 64-bit registers on Darwin.
	* osabi.c (gdb_osabi_names): Add support for 64-bit registers on Darwin.

2003-01-13  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* ltmain.sh (SED): Hard-code to 'sed'.

2003-01-13  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* gettext.m4 (CY_WITH_NLS): Default msgfmt to ':'.

2002-01-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* config.if: Update to autoconf-2.57.

2002-12-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* gettext.m4 (CY_WITH_NLS): Default msgfmt to ':'.

2002-12-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in (NSLIBTOOL): Use cc -dynamiclib.
	(stamp-gdb-framework): Restore; was deleted in merge.
	* configure (--build): Check for NOBUILD, not "".

2002-12-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* libtool.m4: Remove.
	* ltcf-c.sh: Remove.
	* ltcf-cxx.sh: Remove.
	* ltcf-gcj.sh: Remove.
	* ltconfig: Remove.

2002-12-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

        * configure: Change the rules for build/host/target processing to
        the following:

        The inputs are:
          configure --host=HOST --target=TARGET UNDEFS
          configure --build=BUILD --host=HOST --target=TARGET UNDEFS

        The rules are:
          1. You aren't allowed to specify --host, --build, --target, and undefs
             at the same time.
          2. Build defaults to undefs.
          3. If undefs is not specified, then build defaults to the current host,
             as determined by config.guess.
          4. Host defaults to undefs.
          5. If undefs is not specified, then host defaults to build.
          6. Target defaults to undefs.
          7. If undefs is not specified, then target defaults to host.

        Only pass --host= and --target= to sub-configures when they are
        passed by the top-level configure.  Treat the build as a
        cross-compilation whenever --target is specified, even if it
        matches the value of --build and --host.

2002-12-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

        * .cvsignore: Add autom4te.cache.

2002-11-21  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* depcomp: Update to the version from automake-1.7.
	* missing: Update to the version from automake-1.7.

2002-11-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* configure.in: Generalize the Darwin config to *-*-darwin* (not
	just PowerPC).  Remove bfd, binutils, opcodes, gdb, and gprof from
	noconfigdirs.

2002-11-05  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove extra definition of clean-target, to
	match FSF sources.

2002-11-05  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* ylwrap: Update to automake-1.7.

2002-10-28  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>
	
	* gettext.m4: Enable use of libtool for libintl (set l=l,
	INTLDEPS=libintl.la).
	* ltcf-c.sh: Move darwin/rhapsody section from the "using GNU
	linker" portion of the script to the "not using GNU linker"
	section.  Also recognize powerpc-apple-macos10* as a valid string.
	Set ac_cv_prog_cc_pic, not lt_cv_prog_cc_pic.
	* ltconfig: Default CONFIG_SHELL to /bin/sh.  Also recognize
	powerpc-apple-macos10* as a valid string.  Remove extra '$' in
	library_names_spec, that was leading to libraries named
	libname.1.$dylib instead of libname.1.dylib.
	
2002-10-14  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

        * configure.in: Update powerpc-apple-darwin* target to include
	ia86, and to build gdb and binutils.

2002-10-07  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

        * install-sh: Revert to Cygnus version.

2002-09-12  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile.in: Remove a few extraneous diffs from FSF Makefile.in.

2002-08-30  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* configure: Accidentally nuked Jason's check to set --build
	to $host_alias; restored it.
	
	* configure.in: Skip expect if $build != $host.  The previous
	test would skip expect whenever building for i386.

2002-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb/configure.in: By default, assume --with-mmalloc.  There
	is a file in gdb/macosx/ which requires mmalloc to compile.
	* gdb/acconfig.h: Updated.
	* gdb/Makefile.in: Remove electric-fence use.
	(YLWRAP): Reorder calls to ylwrap to conform to new usage.

	* tcl/unix/configure.in: Reorder gettimeofday() checks; maybe
	it's an autoconf bug, maybe it's an edge case, but this little
	hack works around it.

	* Makefile.in:  Remove electric-fence targets, dependencies.
	* configure.in: Remove electric-fence.
	Grab latest version of file from FSF.

	* configure: Grab latest version of file from FSF.
	* install-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs, ylwrap: Update from automake-1.6.

	* bfd/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* bfd/Makefile.am:  Drop electric-fence.
	* binutils/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* binutils/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* config/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* gas/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* gdb/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* ld/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* libiberty/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* libiberty/xmalloc.c: Remove electric-fence calls.
	* opcodes/acinclude.m4: Update from FSF version.
	* opcodes/Makefile.am: Drop electric-fence.
	* readline/Makefile.in: Remove electric-fence calls.

2002-08-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* configure:  Fix it in a different place; revert previous
	change.

2002-08-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* configure: Set --build to $host_alias if we're not building
	Canadian cross; avoids a noisy warning from the autoconf-2.52
	generated configure files.

2001-09-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

       * configure:  Darwin's /bin/sh doesn't let you write to $PWD, so don't.
       Apple local change.
