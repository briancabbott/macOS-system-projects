/* This module provides three functions: dbx_symfile_init,
   which initializes to read a symbol file; dbx_new_init, which 
   discards existing cached information when all symbols are being
   discarded; and dbx_symfile_read, which reads a symbol table
   from a file.

   dbx_symfile_read only does the minimum work necessary for letting the
   user "name" things symbolically; it does not read the entire symtab.
   Instead, it reads the external and static symbols and puts them in partial
   symbol tables.  When more extensive information is requested of a
   file, the corresponding partial symbol table is mutated into a full
   fledged symbol table by going back and reading the symbols
   for real.  dbx_psymtab_to_symtab() is the function that does this */
