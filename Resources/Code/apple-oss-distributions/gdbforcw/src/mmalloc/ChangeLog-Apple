2006-05-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mmap-sup.c (__mmalloc_mmap_morecore): port_t -> mach_port_t.
	(mmalloc_findbase): Ditto.

2005-03-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* configure.in: Mark the mmap pre-destination as an apple
	local change.
	* configure: Regenerated.

2005-03-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mmap-sup.c (__mmalloc_map_morecore): Add cast to handle warning.
	(mmalloc_findbase): Use a void* instead of int to store a pointer.
	Add a couple casts to suppress warnings.
	* mmalloc.h (mmalloc_findbase): Update prototype.
	* pagecheck-sup.c (mfree_pagecheck, mrealloc_pagecheck): Add a couple
	of necessary casts.
	* sbrk-sup.c: Include unistd.h unconditionally.
	(sbrk_morecore): Just use void* already.

2003-09-02  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* attach.c (mmalloc_attach): Remove code (previously #ifdef 0'd)
	to re-locate keys to a new base address --- they're not
	necessarily pointers into the malloc pool, so that's never the
	right thing to do automatically.
	
2003-04-21  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mmalloc.h (mmalloc_findbase): Add "suggested baseaddr" as an
	optional second argument; 0 means "use default".
	* mmap-sup.c (mmalloc_findbase): Ditto.
	* attach.c (mmalloc_findbase): Pass suggested baseaddr.

2003-02-23  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mmprivate.h (__mmalloc_remap_core): Remove.	
	* check-sup.c (mmalloc_check_create): Propagate the child's
	flags to the parent.
	* attach.c (MAP_PRIVATE_OR_SHARED): Copy from mmap-sup.c.
	(reuse): Add BASEADDR parameter.
	(mmalloc_attach): Require the caller to provide an explicit
	address at which to map the pool, rather than assuming that an
	address big enough to hold a pool descriptor will also be big
	enough to hold the resulting pool.
	* detach.c (mmalloc_detach): Properly sync, unmap, and close any
	memory-mapped file associated with the pool.
	* mmap-sup.c (__mmalloc_remap_core): Remove.
	(mmalloc_findbase): Implement a Mach-specific variant that
	searches the VM space for open regions.
	(__mmalloc_mmap_morecore): Check to make sure the memory region
	being mapped is not already allocated (mmap does not check, at
	least on Darwin).
	
2002-12-14  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* pagecheck-sup.c (alloc_buffer): Store one longword of
	MAGIC_GUARD even if check_info_guard is not set.
	(validate_buffer): Check for one longword of MAGIC_GUARD even if
	check_info_guard is not set.

2002-11-30  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mmap-sup.c (mmalloc_endpoints): Handle nested mmalloc pools.
	* mmalloc.h (mmalloc_endpoints): Add prototype.
	
2002-11-08  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* pagecheck-sup.c (mmalloc_pagecheck_zero_free): New variable.
	If set, realloc and free will zero out the old memory as well as mark
	it as unreadable.
	(mfree_pagecheck): Honor mmalloc_pagecheck_zero_free.
	(mrealloc_pagecheck): Honor mmalloc_pagecheck_zero_free.

2002-11-05  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add configure variables for PAGECHECK_SRC and
	PAGECHECK_OBJ; use them in CFILES and OFILES.
	* configure.in: Add host-check to determine if we should build
	pagecheck-sup.o.
	* po/Make-in: Revert to use @USE_NLS@ to match FSF sources.
	
2002-11-01  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* pagecheck-sup.c: New file.  Implements a page-protection-based
	debugging malloc.  See the comments in pagecheck-sup.c.

	* Makefile.in: Add pagecheck-sup.c, pagecheck-sup.o.  
	* mmalloc.h: Add prototype for mmalloc_pagecheck_create.
	* mm.c: Add pagecheck-sup.
	
2002-11-01  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in: Convert to build using "traditional" library
	structure, instead of using mm.c.
	* attach.c: Include mmprivate.h _before_ trying to evaluate HAVE_MMAP.
	(mmalloc_attach): Include the 'flags' parameter in the
	non-HAVE_MMAP case.
	* check-sup.c: Include stdlib.h and string.h.
	* detach.c: Include stdlib.h.
	* malloc-sup.c: Include stdlib.h and string.h.
	* mm.c: Move __mmalloc_default_mdp to mmalloc.c.  Remove unistd.h;
	move to individual .c files.
	* mmalloc.c: Move __mmalloc_default_mdp from mm.c.
	* mmap-sup.c: Include config.h _before_ trying to evaluate
	HAVE_MMAP.  Remove X3J11-bait at the end of the file.
	* mmprivate.h: Include config.h.
	* mvalloc.c: Include unistd.h, if available.

2002-05-16  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile.in: add check-sup.c

	* mmprivate.h: add malloc, free, and realloc hooks to mmalloc
	pools, to better support a mmalloc pool that dispatches to system
	malloc with minimal intervention.  also add a "child" mmalloc, to
	support implementing mmcheckf by "chaining" a checking mmalloc
	pool on top of a lower-level implementation pool.

	* mmcheck.c: add abort() to the mmcheck and mmcheckf calls, to
	ensure they're not being used inadvertently (they will cause
	random memory corruption if they are)

	* mmap-sup.c: add mmalloc_endpoints, to support detecting the
	memory range used by a mmap-based mmalloc pool.

	* attach.c, mmap-sup.c: allow MMALLOC_SHARED or MMALLOC_PRIVATE to
	be used when opening a pool to determine the behavior used by
	mmap().

	* mmalloc.h: add declaration for mmalloc_endpoints, mmalloc_check_create.

	* mfree.c: use the new mfree_hook if present
	* mmalloc.c: use the new mmalloc_hook if present

	* malloc-sup.c: use the new mfree/mmalloc/mrealloc hooks to
	implement a mmalloc pool that simply dispatches to the system
	malloc.

	* check-sup.c: implement a "checked" malloc pool, using the child
	pool as the basis for allocating objects.
