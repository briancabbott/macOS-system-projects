/* This module implements main driver of compilation process as well as
   few basic intraprocedural optimizers.

   The main scope of this file is to act as an interface in between
   tree based frontends and the backend (and middle end)

   The front-end is supposed to use following functionality:

    - cgraph_finalize_function

      This function is called once front-end has parsed whole body of function
      and it is certain that the function body nor the declaration will change.

      (There is one exception needed for implementing GCC extern inline function.)

    - cgraph_varpool_finalize_variable

      This function has same behavior as the above but is used for static
      variables.

    - cgraph_finalize_compilation_unit

      This function is called once compilation unit is finalized and it will
      no longer change.

      In the unit-at-a-time the call-graph construction and local function
      analysis takes place here.  Bodies of unreachable functions are released
      to conserve memory usage.

      ???  The compilation unit in this point of view should be compilation
      unit as defined by the language - for instance C frontend allows multiple
      compilation units to be parsed at once and it should call function each
      time parsing is done so we save memory.

    - cgraph_optimize

      In this unit-at-a-time compilation the intra procedural analysis takes
      place here.  In particular the static functions whose address is never
      taken are marked as local.  Backend can then use this information to
      modify calling conventions, do better inlining or similar optimizations.

    - cgraph_assemble_pending_functions
    - cgraph_varpool_assemble_pending_variables

      In non-unit-at-a-time mode these functions can be used to force compilation
      of functions or variables that are known to be needed at given stage
      of compilation

    - cgraph_mark_needed_node
    - cgraph_varpool_mark_needed_node

      When function or variable is referenced by some hidden way (for instance
      via assembly code and marked by attribute "used"), the call-graph data structure
      must be updated accordingly by this function.

    - analyze_expr callback

      This function is responsible for lowering tree nodes not understood by
      generic code into understandable ones or alternatively marking
      callgraph and varpool nodes referenced by the as needed.

      ??? On the tree-ssa genericizing should take place here and we will avoid
      need for these hooks (replacing them by genericizing hook)

    - expand_function callback

      This function is used to expand function and pass it into RTL back-end.
      Front-end should not make any assumptions about when this function can be
      called.  In particular cgraph_assemble_pending_functions,
      cgraph_varpool_assemble_pending_variables, cgraph_finalize_function,
      cgraph_varpool_finalize_function, cgraph_optimize can cause arbitrarily
      previously finalized functions to be expanded.

    We implement two compilation modes.

      - unit-at-a-time:  In this mode analyzing of all functions is deferred
	to cgraph_finalize_compilation_unit and expansion into cgraph_optimize.

	In cgraph_finalize_compilation_unit the reachable functions are
	analyzed.  During analysis the call-graph edges from reachable
	functions are constructed and their destinations are marked as
	reachable.  References to functions and variables are discovered too
	and variables found to be needed output to the assembly file.  Via
	mark_referenced call in assemble_variable functions referenced by
	static variables are noticed too.

	The intra-procedural information is produced and it's existence
	indicated by global_info_ready.  Once this flag is set it is impossible
	to change function from !reachable to reachable and thus
	assemble_variable no longer call mark_referenced.

	Finally the call-graph is topologically sorted and all reachable functions
	that has not been completely inlined or are not external are output.

	??? It is possible that reference to function or variable is optimized
	out.  We can not deal with this nicely because topological order is not
	suitable for it.  For tree-ssa we may consider another pass doing
	optimization and re-discovering reachable functions.

	??? Reorganize code so variables are output very last and only if they
	really has been referenced by produced code, so we catch more cases
	where reference has been optimized out.

      - non-unit-at-a-time

	All functions are variables are output as early as possible to conserve
	memory consumption.  This may or may not result in less memory used but
	it is still needed for some legacy code that rely on particular ordering
	of things output from the compiler.

	Varpool data structures are not used and variables are output directly.

	Functions are output early using call of
	cgraph_assemble_pending_function from cgraph_finalize_function.  The
	decision on whether function is needed is made more conservative so
	uninlininable static functions are needed too.  During the call-graph
	construction the edge destinations are not marked as reachable and it
	is completely relied upn assemble_variable to mark them.
	
     Inlining decision heuristics
        ??? Move this to separate file after tree-ssa merge.

	We separate inlining decisions from the inliner itself and store it
	inside callgraph as so called inline plan.  Refer to cgraph.c
	documentation about particular representation of inline plans in the
	callgraph

	The implementation of particular heuristics is separated from
	the rest of code to make it easier to replace it with more complicated
	implementation in the future.  The rest of inlining code acts as a
	library aimed to modify the callgraph and verify that the parameters
	on code size growth fits.

	To mark given call inline, use cgraph_mark_inline function, the
	verification is performed by cgraph_default_inline_p and
	cgraph_check_inline_limits.

	The heuristics implements simple knapsack style algorithm ordering
	all functions by their "profitability" (estimated by code size growth)
	and inlining them in priority order.

	cgraph_decide_inlining implements heuristics taking whole callgraph
	into account, while cgraph_decide_inlining_incrementally considers
	only one function at a time and is used in non-unit-at-a-time mode.  */
