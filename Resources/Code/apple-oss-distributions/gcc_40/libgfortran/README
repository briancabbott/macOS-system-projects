This is the GNU Fortran 95 Runtime library (libgfortran).
It is intended to be compiled as part of GCC.

Programs must be linked with "-lgfortran -lm". The 'gfortran' driver does this
automatically.

You'll need to apply gcc_config.patch to your top level GCC source directory.
This tells the the GCC configure system about libgfor. This patch can confuse
patch as it contains a filename with a '-' in it. use "patch -p1" to avoid this
problem.
