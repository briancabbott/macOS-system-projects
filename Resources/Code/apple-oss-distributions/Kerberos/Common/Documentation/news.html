<P>Kerberos for Macintosh 3.5 has been released and is available for downloading. This is a major new release of Kerberos for Macintosh for Mac OS 8.x and 9.x.  The 3.5 release incorporates the new UI elements for Classic Mac OS originally introduced in Kerberos for Macintosh 4.0 and Carbon versions of the KfM libraries.

<P>We have created this new release in order to provide you with a new, final-quality Kerberos for Macintosh release in a timely manner.  We expect KfM 4.0 development to continue for some time, mostly due to the Mac OS X work.
