	* Fix bug that prevented you from closing the Prefs dialog after you'd
	  fixed bad lifetime values.
	* If you collapse a ticket list hierarchy with a selection in it, the
	  principal becomes the new selection.
	* Should now display expiration times for caches properly in the
	  "srvtab case" - where realm supports both versions of tix, but only
	  one kind of tix exists.
	* Ticket List, Active User Info, and Ticket Info Windows now display 
	  "not valid" when that is the case (instead less useful "expired").

	  tickets as expired (in addition to overall state being displayed as
	  expired).
	* "Time remaining" now displayed in red if less than 5 minutes remain.
	* Now uses KLLastChangedTime() to detect cache changes.  This should
	  allow it to detect when the tickets become invalid because IP address
	  changed.

	  Window will now display them as "expired".
	* Principal shading should stay grey under all Appearance themes
	  (including Aqua).
	* Ticket list will select the default principal if another ticket list
	  item isn't already selected (this means after you log in, a user will
	  be selected).
	* Combined "About Kerberos" and "About Kerberos for Macintosh" about boxes,
	  so that now we only have one about box that displays only the KfM
	  version number.

	* Add check to keep Carbon version from running under 9 in final release.
	* Fix bug where upgrading from previous release would cause window to
	  be too small (because saved width was smaller than new min width).
	* Back to using TicketKeeperLib instead of TicketKeeperLibGlue.
	* Floater options and launching Ticket Keeper not supported under Carbon
	  (because they need TicketKeeperLib and not all TKLib functions are
	  defined in Carbon).

	  setting minimum and maximum ticket lifetimes (although it's been
	  superseded by the tabbed preferences window).
	* Reorganized and renamed some main window buttons and Kerberos menu
	  items.
	* Can now tear off the active users menu to create the Kerberos
	  floater.
	* No longer links against TicketKeeperLib, so doesn't require bogus
	  library under X.

	  with "by MIT IS MacDev".
	* Rewrote ticket list code to use new, more flexible object classes.

	  class to make KM better able to deal with having multiple windows.
	* Fixed minor bug where KM would crash if it did not get the version
	  of the CCAPI it requested.

Kerberos Manager 1.1
Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0.

	========================================================================

	Kerberos Manager 1.1d7
	Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0d8.
	April 28, 2000
	
	* Now displays v4-only realms in Edit Favorite Realms dialog, so you can
	  add them to the list.
	* v4 credentials and principal now displayed before v5 credentials and
	  principal for mixed-version caches in the ticket list.
	* Now gives warning and ignores preferences resource when it's an
	  unrecognized version.
	* Ignores v1 preference resources (not worth the bother to read them).
	* Fix bug where ticket lifetime preference set by the preferences dialog

	========================================================================

	Kerberos Manager 1.1d5
	Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0d6.
	April 7, 2000
	
	* Now manipulates Login Library realm information instead of using its
	  own iternal realms list.
	* Non-debug version no longer crashes on exit trying to unload a
	  library twice (and freeing a krb5 context twice).
	* Re-enabled debug version launches Ticket Keeper.
	* Determined that we will continue to use gettimeofday() only instead
	  of krb5_us_timeofday() - the CCache will be modified so that its
	  times are "local" not "KDC" time.
	* Fixed numerous memory leaks (some are still reported; most are from
	  either PowerPlant or other parts of KfM, a few may still be KM's own.)
	* Tweaked about box.
	
	========================================================================

	Kerberos Manager 1.1d4
	Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0d5.
	March 23, 2000
	
	* Now uses Login Library KLChangePassword() for "Change Password"
	  function.
	* Draws light grey background on master principals for caches in
	  ticket list for easier reading.
	* Uses gettimeofday() instead of krb5_us_timeofday() for all time
	  comparisons - this is not strictly correct and will be fixed
	  in a future version, but no incorrect times should be displayed.
	* Some code cleanup working towards goal of behaving in v4 or v5-only
	  environments, untested and not completely done.
	
	========================================================================
	Kerberos Manager 1.1d3
	Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0d3 and 3.0d4.
	March 10, 2000
	
	* Now uses Login Library KLAcquireNewTickets() for "New Login" and
	  "Renew" functions.
	* Better display of V4 tickets in ticket list.  Now has "subprincipals"
	  (the representation of the principal for each version) and groups
	  tickets of each Kerberos version together.  (Internally, rewrote to
	  use KrbWrappersLib and KerbLoginLib.)
	* Forwardable tickets now marked with an "(F)" in the ticket list.
	* Debug menu KLAcquireNewTickets option no longer leaks memory, although
	  this is moot since you don't need to use it anymore...
	
	========================================================================

	Kerberos Manager 1.1d2
	Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0d2.
	February 23, 2000
	
	* Main window now resizable, and size is saved in prefs.
	* Fixed bug where KM always tries to launch TK even if TK is
	  already running.
	* Added "Login Library KLAcquireNewTickets" option to the Debug
	  menu so you don't have to run a separate app to do a Login Lib
	  login.  This uses Login Lib v2, but otherwise there isn't
	  full Login Library support in this KM release.
	* Swapped position of "Load KClient Driver" and "Unload KClient
	  Driver" menu items in Debug menu.
	* Don't display asserts when no prefs resource exist at KM startup
	  (this is a situation it can fully deal with).
	* No prefs file is now a fatal error, do not try to create a new prefs
	  file if one exists.  (Because we can't run without or create the
	  .ini information the prefs file now contains.)
	
	========================================================================

	Kerberos Manager 1.1d1
	Released as part of MIT Kerberos for Macintosh 3.0d1.
	February 11, 2000
	
	* Partial support for displaying v4 information in ticket list.
	  In mixed v4/v5 caches, the overall principal and expiration time
	  displayed is based on v5 information.  v4 tickets will be listed
	  in the details with a "(v4)" appended and mixed in with the v5
	  tickets in no particular order.
	  In v4-only caches, the principal is displayed in v4 format (but
	  there is no other indication for coding reasons), and the
	  expiration time is based on v4 information.  v4 tickets are listed
	  in the details with a "(v4)" appended.
	  You can destroy v4-only or mixed v4/v5 caches.
	  You can make v4-only or mixed v4/v5 caches the default, but only
	  the ccache and the v5 libraries will be notifed that you changed
	  the default, v4 library will not.  (v4/v5 notification only
	  applies to application default)
	  There is currently no way to obtain v4 tickets with Kerberos
	  Manager.
	* New Logins not made system default (active user) unless they are
	  the very first login.
	* Active principal now displayed in place (not always at top) in
	  principal list.
	* Kerberos Error dialog made larger so long error descriptions fit.
	* Added macdev@mit.edu address to about box.
	* Updated to use CCache API v3.
	* Removed dependencies on defunct Krb5GlobalsLib.
	* Now PPC-only (removed 68K and FAT targets).
	* Startup check for Ticket Keeper disabled in this version (in debug
	  binary only).
	* Debug menu for loading/unloading KClient driver, launching/killing
	  Ticket Keeper, forcing refresh of ticket list.

============================================================================

	* Fixed memory & CCache leaks when v4 tickets are also in the cache.
	* Now an application ('APPL') again, with a 'rout' resource that tells
	  Mac OS 8.0 and later to put it in the Control Panels folder.  Users
