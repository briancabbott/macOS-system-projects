<H3><a name="ticketlist">About the ticket list</H3> 

<p>Below the Active User box and Renew Tickets, Destroy Tickets, and Change 
Password buttons is the <i>ticket list</i>. The ticket list shows all 
the principals that are currently authenticated on the Macintosh.</p>
<p>Each principal has a set of Kerberos tickets belonging to it. When you 
log in with Kerberos, you get a <i>ticket-granting ticket</i> which then 
allows you to get other tickets from other applications (also called services). 
Then for each application you run that requires Kerberos authentication, 
you get a <i>service ticket</i>.</p>
<p>By default, the principals and their tickets appear as a summary line 
in the ticket list. The summary lines are in bold text with a light gray 
background. Each summary line has three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Kerberos versions supported by the realm the principal is authenticated 
  in. This appears as &quot;(v4/v5)&quot;, &quot;(v4)&quot;, or &quot;(v5)&quot; 
  before the principal. When you log in using Kerberos for Macintosh, 
  it will attempt to get both Kerberos v4 and v5 tickets for your principal. 
  However, not all Kerberos-using sites support both versions, or different 
  realms at the same site may also support different versions, so you 
  may see only one version listed.</li>
<li>The username of the authenticated principal.</li>
<li>The minimum remaining lifetime for the ticket-granting tickets belonging 
  to the principal (displayed as hours:minutes). You receive one ticket-granting 
  ticket for each Kerberos version the realm supports; these may have 
  different expiration times (although Kerberos for Macintosh attempts 
  to make them the same).</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of a time, you may see either &quot;expired&quot; or &quot;not valid&quot; in the Time
Remaining column.  &quot;Expired&quot; means that your tickets have no time remaining and
so are no longer valid; &quot;not valid&quot; means they are no longer valid for some
other reason, usually because your Mac's IP address has changed since you obtained
the tickets.  In either case, you need to renew your tickets (although Kerberos for
Macintosh will also prompt you automatically to renew if you try to use a service
requiring Kerberos tickets).</p>
<p>If you want to see details of tickets associated with each principal, 
click on the triangle at the left of the principal's summary line. The 
list will expand:</p>
<p><img src="Graphics/krbmgr4.gif" alt="Expanded ticket list illustration"></p>
<p>In the expanded list, you will see a list of the tickets (credentials) 
belonging to that principal. If the principal is authenticated for both 
versions of Kerberos, the tickets are grouped by version underneath a 
subheading for each version (see picture above). For Kerberos v5 tickets, 
an &quot;(F)&quot; after the ticket name means the ticket is forwardable, 
a &quot;(P)&quot; means the ticket is proxiable, and &quot;(F,P)&quot; 
means the ticket is both forwardable and proxiable (see <a href="#prefs">Changing 
preferences</a> for more information about forwardable and proxiable).</p>
<p>If you always want the ticket list to display expanded entries, you can 
set the &quot;Always expand new ticket list entries&quot; preference. 
See the <a href="#prefs">Changing preferences</a> section.</p>
<p>You can display even more detailed information about each ticket using 
the Ticket Info window. See the <a href="#ticketinfo">Displaying ticket 
information</a> section.</p>

<H3><A NAME=addrem>Adding and removing realms</A></H3>

<P>A default Kerberos realm is specified by the Kerberos Preferences file 
(as distributed from MIT, this realm is ATHENA.MIT.EDU). When using the 
Kerberos control panel to log in, by default the Kerberos username and 
password entered are checked for authorization in this area of the network. 
You can add other realms, as described in this section, and change which 
one Kerberos Login uses by default. (For instructions on how to change 
the default realm, see <A HREF="#prefs">Changing Preferences</A>.) 
<P>Other realms listed in the Kerberos Preferences file can also be used 
for logging in, but must first be added to the list of &quot;favorite&quot; 
realms which are displayed in the Kerberos Login dialog. The Kerberos 
control panel has a feature called Edit Favorite Realms that provides 
the following options for making the other realms in Kerberos Preferences 
available for use: 
<UL>
<LI>You can add one or multiple realms from the Kerberos Preferences file 
  to the Favorite Realms List. 
  <P>&nbsp; 
</LI>
<LI>If you want to keep the list of Favorite realms to the minimum that 
  you need, you can remove realms from the Favorite Realms List.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although other realms may exist besides the ones through the Edit Favorite 
Realms feature, you can only add or remove realms listed in the Kerberos 
Preferences file. (For information on adding new realms to the Kerberos
preferences file, see the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/Development/MITKerberos/Common/Documentation/preferences.html">Kerberos Preferences Documentation</A>.

<P>&nbsp; 
<LI>Make changes to any of the following: 
  <P>&nbsp; 
  <UL>
	<LI><strong>Login Defaults</strong>: 
	  <ul>
		<li><strong>Remember principal from last Kerberos login/Use this principal 
		  information</strong> (default = &quot;Remember principal from 
		  last login&quot;): This popup menu lets you chose whether to 
		  retain the username, instance, and principal in the Kerberos 
		  Login dialog box after each time you log in, or to use the options 
		  specified in the Preferences dialog each time. 
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>Always use blank username</strong> (default) (only 
			  applies if &quot;Use this principal information&quot; is 
			  selected): The username and instance fields will always 
			  be blank in the Kerberos Login dialog. </li>
			<li><strong>Always use this username</strong> (only applies 
			  if &quot;Use this principal information&quot; is selected): 
			  The username field of the Kerberos dialog will always be 
			  the specified username, and the instance field will always 
			  be blank. (You can edit the username field to be something 
			  different for a single login, but it will always return 
			  to this user on next login.) </li>
			<li><strong>Always use this realm</strong> (only applies if 
			  &quot;Use this principal information&quot; is selected): 
			  The realm selected from this popup will always appear as 
			  the selected realm in the Kerberos Login dialog's realm 
			  popup. If the realm you want is not in the popup list, use 
			  the <A HREF="#addrem"><STRONG>Edit Favorite Realms</STRONG></A> 
			  to add realms, then return to the Preferences dialog and 
			  choose the desired from the Realm popup list. </li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Remember ticket options from last Kerberos login/Use these 
		  ticket options</strong> (default = &quot;Remember ticket options 
		  from last login&quot;): This popup menu lets you chose whether 
		  to retain the forwardable, proxiable, and ticket lifetime options 
		  in the Kerberos Login dialog box after each time you log in, 
		  or to use the options specified in the Preferences dialog each 
		  time. 
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>Forwardable tickets always</strong> (default=on) 
			  (only applies if &quot;Use these ticket options&quot; is 
			  selected): Tickets that you've obtained on your machine 
			  are valid on another machine to which you are connecting. 
			  (We recommend that you leave this option turned on.) Only 
			  applies to Kerberos v5 tickets. </li>
			<li><strong>Proxiable tickets always</strong> (default=off) 
			  (only applies if &quot;Use these ticket options&quot; is 
			  selected): Tickets are proxiable. Proxiable tickets are 
			  used by some Windows 2000 Kerberos services, however, you 
			  should not turn on proxiable tickets unless instructed to 
			  do so by your system administrator. Only applies to Kerberos 
			  v5 tickets. </li>
			<li><strong>Ticket lifetime always</strong> (default=10 hours) 
			  (only applies if &quot;Use these ticket options&quot; is 
			  selected): To change the duration for tickets to be valid, 
			  place the mouse pointer on the Ticket Lifetime slider and 
			  drag it to desired time indicated above the slider. NOTE: 
			  Changes you make to this setting take effect the next time 
			  you obtain tickets. Any tickets that you currently have 
			  maintain the lifetime that was set when you obtained them</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	</LI>
	<li><strong>Display</strong>: 
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Always expand new ticket list entries</strong> (default=off): 
		To have the full list of your individual tickets displayed in 
		the ticket list by default (as opposed to a summary of your tickets indicated 
		by your username) click once in the checkbox to activate it. See 
		<a href="#ticketlist">About the ticket list</a> for more details.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Floating Window</strong>: 
	  <ul>
		<li><strong>Show floating window</strong> (default = off): If 
		  this box is checked, the Kerberos Floating Window will be displayed.</li>
		<li><strong>Floating window can be closed</strong> (default = 
		  on): If this box is checked, the Kerberos Floating Window has a close 
		  box and can be closed. (You'll have to use the &quot;show floating 
		  window&quot; preference or tear the menu off the Kerberos Menu/Control Strip
		  to display it again.) Note that unlike  in old versions of KClient,
		  closing the floating window does not destroy any tickets, it simply
		  hides the floating window.</li>
		<li><strong>Show commands in floating window</strong> (default 
		  = off): The Kerberos Floating Window has two states, a simple compact 
		  state where only the usernames of the currently authenticated 
		  users are displayed, or an expanded state where Get Ticket, 
		  Destroy Tickets, and Renew Tickets commands are displayed along 
		  with the authenticated users. If this box is checked, the floating window 
		  is displayed in its expanded state with the commands. You can 
		  also switch between the compact and expanded states of the floating window 
		  by clicking on the zoom box in the floating window's title bar.</li>
		<li><strong>Show remaining lifetime &quot;pie&quot; in floating 
		  window</strong> (default = on): If this box is checked, a small 
		  circle indicating the relative amount of time remaining until 
		  the user's tickets expire is displayed next to each authenticated 
		  user's name.</li>
		<li>For more information about the Kerberos Floating Window, see the <a href="../../TicketKeeper/Documentation/using-floater.html">Using 
		  the Kerberos Floating Window</a> documentation. </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Lifetimes</strong>: 
	  <ul>
		<li>Using the edit fields in this preferences panel, you can set 
		  the minimum and maximum range of the ticket lifetime slider 
		  displayed by the Kerberos Login dialog. You can also set the default 
		  ticket lifetime (this is the same as the &quot;ticket lifetime 
		  always&quot; option in the Login Defaults preferences). These 
		  settings only control the minimum and maximum lifetimes your 
		  Macintosh requests from the Kerberos server; the Kerberos server 
		  may not allow tickets longer or shorter than certain lifetimes. 
		  (Defaults are 0:10:00 minimum, 10:00:00 maximum, and 10:00:00 
		  default.) </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
  </UL>
