<h1>Network Identity Manager Concepts: Identity</h1>

<p>While there are many approaches to defining what an identity is, as
far as the Network Identity Manager (NetIDMgr) is considered, an identity is the unique
user identifier that is accepted by a network service.  Each credential
that is managed by NetIDMgr is assumed to map to a single identity.
The collection of credentials that map to a single identity is
considered to belong to that identity.

<h3>Default Identity</h3>

<p>The default identity is the identity that will be used by
applications when a specific identity has not been requested.  
The Kerberos v5 plug-in will mark the credential cache that 
contains the default identity as the default credentials
cache for the current logon session.
