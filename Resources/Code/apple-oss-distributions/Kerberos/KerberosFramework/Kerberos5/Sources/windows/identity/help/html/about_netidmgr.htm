<h1>About Network Identity Manager</h1>

<p>
This is strictly an informative page about the origins of Network
Identity Manager.
</p>

<h3>In the beginning</h3>

<p>
Network Identity Manager was conceived as an identity management
solution to make up for the shortcomings of Leash32 (distributed with
MIT Kerberos for Windows) and AFSCreds (distributed with OpenAFS).
</p>

<p>
The work started as Unified Credentials Manager, a final project for
the MIT course 6.831 : User Interface Design and Implementation,
taught by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rcm/">Professor Rob
Miller</a>.  By the time actual code was written, it was named
Khimaira (which was later changed to Network Identity Manager around
October, 2005).  Traces of the name Khimaira might still exist in the
source code.
</p>

<p>
Khimaira was presented at the <a
href="http://www.pmw.org/afsbpw05/">AFS and Kerberos Best Practices
Workshop 2005</a>.  The slides can be found on the workshop website and <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/asanka/www/misc.shtml">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The work on Network Identity Manager was supported by <a
href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a> <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/ist/">Information Services and
Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov">NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>,
and <a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com">Secure Endpoints Inc.</a>.
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
A plugin based architecture was chosen so that support for additional
credential types and features could be added without making changes to
the mainline code.  In addition to making the application easily
extensible, this also allows the AFS plugin to be maintained within
the OpenAFS code base and separates the code supporting Kerberos 5 and
Kerberos 4.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that this would encourage
third party developers to develop plugins for NetIDMgr.
