                 All about wxWidgets Version Numbers
                 ===================================

1. Where to update the version numbers:

   There are several places in the wxWidgets source tree that
   define the version number for the library.  When updating the
   version number all of these files must be edited:

   configure.in
   *.spec
   build/bakefiles/version.bkl {C:R:A}
   build/osx/wxvers.xcconfig
   docs/changes.txt
   docs/doxygen/Doxyfile_inc (PROJECT_NUMBER)
   docs/doxygen/latexdocstart.inc
   docs/doxygen/mainpages/manual.h (just date)
   docs/msw/install.txt {major release only}
   include/wx/version.h
   include/wx/osx/config_xcode.h
   samples/Info.plist
   samples/docview/Info.plist
   samples/minimal/borland_ide.cpp {major release only}

   the release field of the version, i.e. changing 2.8.x to 2.8.x+1.
