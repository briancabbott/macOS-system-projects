\chapter{Overview}

\ClamAV allows users to deploy and use their own (or third party) virus signatures in
addition to the official virus signatures.
The virus signature database updater (\gls{freshclam}) can also be adapted to the
user's environment.

This is usually done by editing the configuration file \gls{freshclam.conf}, and copying the custom signatures to the database
directory.

However \CW protects the database directory against changes, even if those changes are attempted by a user with \emph{Administrator} privileges. 
A new tool is needed to make these changes: \textbf{Signature configuration UI} (SigUI).

\section{Features}
Using \emph{SigUI} an \emph{Administrator} can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Configure \gls{freshclam} to use a proxy
\item Configure which mirror \gls{freshclam} should use
\item Configure updates of custom signatures by \gls{freshclam}
\item Manually copy virus signature databases to \ClamAV's database directory
\item Deploy an existing \gls{freshclam.conf} \footnote{created using SigUI} to multiple machines
\end{itemize}

\section{Using SigUI}
\subsection{Launching the application}

The application can be launched from the \emph{Start Menu}:
Start $\to$ All Programs $\to$ ClamAV for Windows $\to$ SigUI \includegraphics{sigui_menu.jpg}

Or you can navigate to the installation directory of \CW
\footnote{\texttt{C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash ClamAV for Windows} by default},
and from the \texttt{clamav} subfolder launch \texttt{sigui.exe}:\\
\includegraphics{sigui_icon.jpg}

In either case you must run this program with administrative privileges.
On \emph{Windows Vista} and later you will get the UAC popup to grant Administrator privileges to the application \footnote{If you are running as a user that has Administrator privileges, this is a simple "I Allow/Continue" style popup, otherwise it asks you for a login and password of a user with Administrator privileges}. On earlier versions you will need to login as \verb+Administrator+.

\subsection{How it works}

When changing \gls{freshclam} settings via the UI, it first verifies that the
settings are syntactically correct, and saves them in \gls{freshclam.conf}.

When installing custom signatures, \verb+SigUI+ verifies that \ClamAV can successfully load the databases, and install only those that are successfully loaded.

Once the databases are successfully installed, a reload is queued. ClamAV for Windows will reload the databases the next time the system is idle. SigUI will show a notification when the reload happens.
