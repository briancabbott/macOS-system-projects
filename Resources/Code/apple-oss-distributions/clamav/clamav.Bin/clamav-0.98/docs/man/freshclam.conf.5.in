.SH "DIRECTIVES"
.LP 
When an option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configuration file) freshclam takes a default action.
.TP 
\fBExample\fR
If this option is set freshclam will not run.
.TP 
\fBDatabaseOwner STRING\fR
When started by root, drop privileges to a specified user. 
.br

.TP 
\fBUpdateLogFile STRING\fR
Enable logging to a specified file. Highly recommended.
.br 
Default: disabled.

Limit the size of the log file. The logger will be automatically disabled if the file is greater than SIZE. Value of 0 disables the limit.
.br
Default: 1M
.TP 
\fBLogSyslog BOOL\fR

.br 
Default: disabled.

.br 
Default: disabled
.TP 
\fBLogVerbose BOOL\fR

.br 
Default: disabled
.TP 
\fBDNSDatabaseInfo STRING\fR
This directive enables database and software version checks through DNS TXT records.
.br 
Default: enabled, pointing to current.cvd.clamav.net
.TP 
\fBDatabaseMirror STRING\fR
Server name where database updates are downloaded from. In order to download the database from the closest mirror you should configure freshclam to use db.xy.clamav.net where xy represents your country code. If this option is given multiple times, freshclam(1) tries them in the order given. It's strongly recommended that you use db.xy.clamav.net as the first mirror and database.clamav.net as the second.
.br 
Default: database.clamav.net
.TP 
\fBMaxAttempts NUMBER\fR
How many attempts (per mirror) to make before giving up.
.br .
Default: 3 (per mirror)
.TP 
\fBScriptedUpdates BOOL\fR
With this option you can control scripted updates. It's highly recommended to keep it enabled.
.br .
Default: enabled
.TP 
\fBTestDatabases BOOL\fR
With this option enabled, freshclam will attempt to load new databases into memory to make sure they are properly handled by libclamav before replacing the old ones.
.br .
Default: enabled
.TP 
\fBCompressLocalDatabase BOOL\fR
By default freshclam will keep the local databases (.cld) uncompressed to make their handling faster. With this option you can enable the compression; the change will take effect with the next database update.
.br 
Default: no
.TP 
\fBDatabaseCustomURL STR\fR
With this option you can provide custom sources (http:// or file://) for database files. This option can be used multiple times.
.br 
Default: no custom URLs
.TP 
\fBPrivateMirror STR\fR
This option allows you to easily point freshclam to private mirrors. If PrivateMirror is set, freshclam does not attempt to use DNS to determine whether its databases are out-of-date, instead it will use the If-Modified-Since request or directly check the headers of the remote database files. For each database, freshclam first attempts to download the CLD file. If that fails, it tries to download the CVD file. This option overrides DatabaseMirror, DNSDatabaseInfo and ScriptedUpdates. It can be used multiple times to provide fall-back mirrors.
.br 
Default: disabled
.TP 
\fBHTTPProxyServer STR\fR, \fBHTTPProxyPort NUMBER\fR
Use given proxy server and TCP port for database downloads. HTTPProxyPort defaults to 8080.
.TP 
\fBHTTPProxyUsername STR\fR,\fBHTTPProxyPassword STRING\fR
Proxy usage is authenticated through given username and password.
.br .
Default: no proxy authentication
.TP

.br .
Default: clamav/version_number

.TP 
\fBNotifyClamd STRING\fR
Notify a running clamd(8) to reload its database after a download has occurred. The path for clamd.conf file must be provided.
.br .
Default: The default is to not notify clamd. See clamd.conf(5)\'s option SelfCheck for how clamd(8) handles database updates in this case.
.TP 
\fBOnUpdateExecute STRING\fR
Execute this command after the database has been successfully updated.
.br 
Default: disabled

.br 
Default: disabled
.TP

.TP
\fBSubmitDetectionStats STRING\fR
When enabled freshclam will submit statistics to the ClamAV Project about the latest virus detections in your environment. The ClamAV maintainers will then use this data to determine what types of malware are the most detected in the field and in what geographic area they are. Freshclam will connect to clamd in order to get the recent statistics. The path for clamd.conf file must be provided.
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBDetectionStatsCountry STRING\fR
Country of origin of malware/detection statistics (for statistical purposes only). The statistics collector at ClamAV.net will look up your IP address to determine the geographical origin of the malware reported by your installation. If this installation is mainly used to scan data which comes from a different location, please enable this option and enter a two-letter code (see http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/) of the country of origin.
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBDetectionStatsHostID STRING\fR
This option enables support for our "Personal Statistics" service. When this option is enabled, the information on malware detected by your clamd installation is made available to you through our website. To get your HostID, log on http://www.stats.clamav.net and add a new host to your host list. Once you have the HostID, uncomment this option and paste the HostID here. As soon as your freshclam starts submitting information to our stats collecting service, you will be able to view the statistics of this clamd installation by logging into http://www.stats.clamav.net with the same credentials you used to generate the HostID. For more information refer to: http://www.clamav.net/support/faq/faq-cctts/. This feature requires SubmitDetectionStats to be enabled.
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBSafeBrowsing BOOL\fR
This option enables support for Google Safe Browsing. When activated for the first time, freshclam will download a new database file (safebrowsing.cvd) which will be automatically loaded by clamd and clamscan during the next reload, provided that the heuristic phishing detection is turned on. This database includes information about websites that may be phishing sites or possible sources of malware. When using this option, it's mandatory to run freshclam at least every 30 minutes. Freshclam uses the ClamAV's mirror infrastructure to distribute the database and its updates but all the contents are provided under Google's terms of use. See http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=70015 and http://safebrowsing.clamav.net for more information.

Default: disabled
.TP
\fBBytecode BOOL\fR
This option enables downloading of bytecode.cvd, which includes additional detection mechanisms and improvements to the ClamAV engine.
