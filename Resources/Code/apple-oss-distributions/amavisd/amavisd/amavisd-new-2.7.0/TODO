SMTP, LMTP, mail address handling
- split_localpart(): check 'owner-special' handling, e.g. foo-request-spam@
- separate the application from SMTP protocol handling
- fallback relays, MX backups?
- one_response_for_all: report (propagate) all MTA SMTP responses if different

MAIL MODIFICATIONS, EXPAND, NOTIFICATIONS:
- make possible to use proper MIME content structure in notifications;
- optionally attach (chopped?) mail body to DSN?
- use modified headers (and body?) as provided by SA ?
- macro expander: do not replace formal arguments %<n> which are within
  quoted replacement text (in the regexp macro as well);
- use macro expander instead of simple string replacements
  in Subject template edits;
- provide per-recipient 'header_edits' property so that custom hooks
  will be able to add per-recipient headers; suggested by Jacob Leaver;
- per-virus notifications, e.g. include URL or instructions in DSN
  (could make use of associative arrays in EXPAND if available);
- don't send notifications if notifications text turns out to be empty,
  making it possible for a macro expansion during customization
  to turn off DSN (Florian Effenberger);
- choose the admin sender address and From header in DSN
  based on recipient address/domain (how to handle multiple recipient mail?);

VIRUS AND OTHER MALWARE SCANNING:
- some virus scanners need option '--mbox' when given full mail file,
  but not on already decoded parts (Michael Boelen);
- some scanners need proper file name extension to be able to recognize
  and decode a file correctly;
- viruses_that_recips_dont_care_about;
- optimize-away banned checks when bypassing banned checks is requested
  and $banned_namepath_re is used;
- keep consulting a blacklist even if spam checking is bypassed;

MAIL DECODING/DE-ARCHIVING:
- unwrap pgp/gpg armoring, especially on signed-only messages;
- file(1) is unable to differentiate or recognize various types
  of pgp/gpg mail (signed/encrypted/armored/signature/key);
- per-recipient bypass_decoding;
- yEnc encoding www.yenc.org (NNTP); Appledouble encoding, Macintosh StuffIt;
- store_mgr: stop_expensive_decoding_at=n ?
- seek some solution to prevent decoder from attempting to create files
  outside of its designated directory;
- provide separate failure modes of expected (I/O, system) and unexpected
  errors when decoding;

INTERNALS, CODING, ...
- amavis-milter.c: be able to approve locally originating DSN without
  calling amavisd to avoid deadlock (or the need to force '-odd');
- use timers in a manner providing some resiliency to clock jumps;
- use multi-timers Perl module? make timer independent of its use by SA;

QUARANTINE
- provide per-recipient headers such as X-Spam* scores in the quarantined msg;
- do the quarantining later in the flow (after forwarding) to be able
  to do the correct intersect between per-recipient quarantine_to
  and per-recipient kill level and other blockings;
- disable quarantine (and virus admin notifications) based on virus name;
- automatically turn off quarantinining when mail is to be delivered;
- update msgrcpt.rs field after a quarantine release;
- support quarantining by MTA (milter, HOLD);
- invoke sa-learn when releasing false positives from quarantine;

GENERAL, NEW FEATURES
- provide a LDAP and SQL proxy (or make use of the Postfix proxy_read_maps)
  to reduce the number of sessions to LDAP and SQL server;
- "reverse AM.PDP" - lookups on external information sources or provide
  information to external plugins;
- should bypass* implicitly turn on *lovers?
- do not notify recipient when they will receive mail anyway (D_PASS,*_lovers)
- notify when placing on HOLD at MTA ?
- configurable action on HOLD ?
- timeout -> HOLD ?
- notify at double bounce? (treat/describe as DISCARD)
- store information about detected virus names to SQL when logging to SQL
- AM.PDP should be able to split mail by discarding a request and explicitly
  re-sending it
- README.sql-pg: change SQL datatype VARCHAR into VARBINARY for data fields
  mail_id, secret_id and quar_loc, and CHAR into BINARY for msgs.content and
  msgs.quar_type to preserve case sensitivity on string comparison operators
  (same change have already been done in README.sql-mysql, but the data type
  in amavisd calls have not yet been changed);

DOCUMENTATION
- documentation, documentation, documentation;
- malformed mail project and the like: tests, write FAQ;
- cleaner web page;

SOME OF THE MORE SELF-CONTAINED PROJECTS
- Net::Server IPv6 support;
- write a Perl module for interfacing with libarchive
  (http://people.freebsd.org/~kientzle/libarchive/), which is an
  ambitious (currently primarily FreeBSD) programming library that can
  create and read several streaming archive formats, including most
  popular tar variants and the POSIX cpio format.
