INSTALL          installation instructions
README_FILES/    MTA-specific instructions and other documentation
README_FILES/amavisd-new-docs.html  a more detailed documentation on selected
                 topics (a work in progress), the most recent version is at:
                   http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/amavisd-new-docs.html

amavisd          the amavisd-new daemon (should go into /usr/local/sbin/)
amavisd.conf     its configuration file (should go into /etc/)
amavisd.conf-default  lists all configuration variables with their defaults
amavisd-custom.conf   example custom hooks, to be invoked from amavisd.conf

amavisd-release  a program to request releasing a message from a quarantine

amavisd-submit   a simple program to pass an email message to amavisd daemon
                 and to adjust its exit status according to a response received

amavisd-agent    a demo program to access and display SNMP-like counters
                 being updated and made available as a Berkeley DB by amavisd
                 (there currently is no equivalent to this utility when
                 ZMQ is used instead of a Berkeley DB, use a SNMP AgentX
                 and snmpbulkwalk for similar functionality)

amavisd-nanny    a program to show status and keep an eye on health
                 of child processes in amavisd-new, using Berkeley DB

amavisd-status   equivalent to amavisd-nanny, but uses ZMQ as a communication
                 protocol instead of a Berkeley DB database

amavisd-snmp-subagent  a SNMP AgentX program, exporting the amavisd
                 statistical counters and gauges database (stored as a
                 Berkeley DB database) as well as a process health database
                 to a snmpd daemon supporting AgentX protocol (RFC 2741),
                 such a NET-SNMP;

amavisd-snmp-subagent-zmq  equivalent to amavisd-snmp-subagent, but uses
                 ZMQ as a communications protocol instead of Berkeley DB

amavis-services  a supporting service needed when ZMQ is used as a
                 communications protocol. It handles communication between
                 amavisd processes and utilities (like amavisd-status and
                 amavisd-snmp-subagent-zmq), and keeps track on health of
                 amavisd child processes. The program implements several
                 (currently 3) tasks, each runs as an independent process.
                 Must run under the same UID as amavisd. Typically started
                 and stopped by an amavis-mc process.

amavis-mc        a master control program (to be started by a startup script,
                 runs as root) to spawn needed amavis-services processes with
                 dropped privileges and to keep an eye on them, restarting
                 each if needed, and stopping them on an amavis-mc shutdown

amavis-mc_init.sh  a sample FreeBSD rc.d shell script for starting
                 and stopping amavis-mc process

AMAVIS-MIB.txt   The MIB module (SNMP Management information base)
                 describing amavisd-new statistics and health information.
                 Useful to a SNMP client program such as snmpwalk or Cacti;

amavisd-signer   A DKIM signing service daemon for amavisd. It uses an AM.PDP
                 protocol lookalike to receive a request from amavisd and
                 provides two services: choosing a signing key, and signing
                 a message digest with a chosen DKIM private key.
                 Amavisd uses this signing service configured through
                 a $dkim_signing_service setting if it is nonempty;

p0f-analyzer.pl  a program to interface amavisd with a p0f v2 utility
                 (currently p0f v3 is not yet supported)

JpegTester.pm    a Perl module needed if 'check-jpeg' AV checker entry
                 is enabled; to be placed in Perl include paths if needed;

test-messages/   contains sample/test mail messages

TODO             missing features, wish list, ...
