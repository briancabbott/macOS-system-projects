$ sendmail -i your-address@example.com <sample-nonspam.txt
$ sendmail -i your-address@example.com <sample-spam-GTUBE-junk.txt
$ sendmail -i your-address@example.com <sample-spam-GTUBE-nojunk.txt

$ sendmail -i your-address@example.com <sample-42-mail-bomb.txt
$ sendmail -i your-address@example.com <sample-badh.txt
