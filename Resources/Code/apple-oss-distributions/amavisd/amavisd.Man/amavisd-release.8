.\" # This is amavisd-release, an EXAMPLE quarantine release utility program.
.\" # It uses AM.PDP protocol to send a request to amavisd daemon to release
.\" # a quarantined mail message.
.\" #
.\" # Usage:
.\" #   amavisd-release mail_file secret_id [alt_recip1 alt_recip2 ..]
.\" #
.\" # To be placed in amavisd.conf:
.\" #   $interface_policy{'SOCK'} = 'AM.PDP';
.\" #   $policy_bank{'AM.PDP'} = {protocol=>'AM.PDP'};
.\" #   $unix_socketname='/var/amavis/amavisd.sock';
.\" #or:
.\" #   $interface_policy{'9998'} = 'AM.PDP';
.\" #   $policy_bank{'AM.PDP'} = {protocol=>'AM.PDP'};
.\" #   $inet_socket_port = [10024,9998];
.\" #
.\" # To obtain secret_id and quar_type belonging to some mail_id:
.\" # $ mysql mail_log -e \
.\" #   'select secret_id,quar_type,content from msgs where mail_id="W+7uJyXUjw32"'
.\" #
.\" # If secret_id is not available, administrator may choose to skip checking
.\" # of secret_id in the amavisd daemon by setting a configuration variable
.\" # $auth_required_release to false (it defaults to true). If the release
.\" # client program specifies a nonempty secret_id in the request, the secret_id
.\" # will be validated and a request will fail if not valid, regardless of the
.\" # setting of $auth_required_release. Turning off a requirement for a valid
.\" # secret_id widens the right to release to anyone who can connect to amavisd
.\" # socket (Unix or inet). Access to the socket therefore needs to be restricted
.\" # using socket protection (unix socket) or @inet_acl (for inet socket).
