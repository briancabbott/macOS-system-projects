   --  Process a project file tree into project file data structures.
   --  If Report_Error is null, use the error reporting mechanism.
   --  Otherwise, report errors using Report_Error.
   --
   --  If Follow_Links is False, it is assumed that the project doesn't contain
   --  any file duplicated through symbolic links (although the latter are
   --  still valid if they point to a file which is outside of the project),
   --  and that no directory has a name which is a valid source name.
   --
   --  Process is a bit of a junk name, how about Process_Project_Tree???
