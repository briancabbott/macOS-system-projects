This package implements the System V poll(2) system call for Unix-like
systems that do not provide poll(). Poll() provides a method for
multiplexing input and output on multiple open file descriptors; in
traditional BSD systems, that capability is provided by select(). While the
semantics of select() differ from those of poll(), poll() can be readily
emulated in terms of select() -- which is how this function is implemented.

Brief documentation on this emulation can be found at the top of the
"poll.h" header file.  For a full description of poll(), consult W. Richard
Stevens' excellent book, Unix Network Programming (Prentice-Hall, 1990).
The software should compile on most BSD UNIX systems without modification.
I have successfully compiled it on:

	BSD/OS (BSDI) 1.1, 2.0, 2.1
	FreeBSD 2.1.0 through 4.3-RELEASE

In addition, Benjamin Reed <ranger@befunk.com> has supplied the necessary
Makefile changes to build it on:

	Mac OS X (Darwin)
