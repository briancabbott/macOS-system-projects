.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrman_html_split\fP script reads a file containing HTML produced
from a manual page by the \fBrman\fP(1) program, and splits it into a
set of files, each containing one section or subsection of the manual.
Each section file has added to it an optional header identifying the
program described by the manual page, a link to the table of contents,
and links to the previous section and the next section.  The separate
section files are placed in a subdirectory.  A symbolic link named
\fIindex.\|html\fP is created in this subdirectory, linked to either
\fIsect0.\|html\fP (the first section) or \fItoc.\|html\fP (the table
of contents section).
.PP
Use this script to split a large manual page into smaller, more
manageable parts for use as online web-based documentation.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR  "\-d \fIdir\fP" " | "  "\-\-html\-dir \fIdir\fP"
Place output into directory \fIdir\fP.  The default directory name is
\fIhtml\fP.
.TP
.BR "\-m \fInum\fP" " | "  "\-\-merge \fInum\fP"
Merge sections 0 thru \fInum\fP into one file.  The default for
\fInum\fP is 1, since usually section 0 is the NAME section and
section 1 is SYNOPSIS, which are usually both short and go well
together.  Set
.I num
to 0 to prevent merging, or set it to a larger number to merge more
initial sections.  Maximum value of \fInum\fP is 9. There is no
provision for merging sections other than consecutive numbers from
section 0.
.TP
.BR \-t " | "  \-\-toc\-first
Link \fIindex.\|html\fP to the table of contents.  By default, it is
linked to \fIsect0.\|html\fP.  Use this if you prefer the initial page
to be the table of contents rather than the first section of the
manual page.
.TP
.BR "\-T \fItitle\fP" " | "  "\-\-title \fItitle\fP"
Use \fItitle\fP as a header on top of each page.  This header is
displayed using the H2 HTML tag.  By default, \fBrman_html_split\fP uses
the title generated by \fBrman\fP.  By making \fItitle\fP the empty
string (""), the header can be suppressed entirely.
