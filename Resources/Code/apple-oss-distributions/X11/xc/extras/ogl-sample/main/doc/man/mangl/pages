Each line corresponds to a single manpage text body.
Lines with comma-separated command names, and with the
parenthetical (both share one page description, two
entry points) do just that: they share a single text
body, but have multiple instantiations.  Lines with
comma-separated command names, and with the
parenthetical (one page, one entry point) simply share
a single page.
