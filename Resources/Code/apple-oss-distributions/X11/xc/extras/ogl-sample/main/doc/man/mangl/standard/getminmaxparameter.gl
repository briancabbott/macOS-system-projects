.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(__target)
Must be
_const(MINMAX).
_phead(__pname)
The parameter to be retrieved.
Must be one of
_const(MINMAX_FORMAT) or
_const(MINMAX_SINK).
_phead(__params)
A pointer to storage for the retrieved parameters.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd retrieves parameters for the current minmax table by setting
__pname to one of the following values:
.sp

.TS
center;
lb lb
l l.
_
Parameter	Description
_
_const(MINMAX_FORMAT)	Internal format of minmax table
_const(MINMAX_SINK)	Value of the \f2sink\fP parameter
_
.TE

.SH NOTES
_cmnd is present only if _arbstring(imaging) is returned when _cmnd(GetString)
is called with an argument of _const(EXTENSIONS).
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if __target is not _const(MINMAX).
.P
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if __pname is not one of the allowable
values.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).
