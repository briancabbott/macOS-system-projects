.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the quadrics object (created with _cmnd(NewQuadric)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies a flag indicating if texture coordinates should be generated.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies if texture coordinates should be generated
for quadrics rendered with _param1.
If the value of _param2 is _const(TRUE), then texture coordinates 
are generated, and if _param2 is _const(FALSE), they are not.  The
initial value is _const(FALSE).
.P
The manner in which texture coordinates are generated depends 
upon the specific quadric rendered.
