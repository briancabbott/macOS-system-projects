.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the data type of each coordinate in the array. 
Symbolic constants
_const(BYTE),
_const(SHORT),
_const(INT),
_const(FLOAT), and
_const(DOUBLE) 
are accepted. The initial value is _const(FLOAT). 
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the byte offset between consecutive normals. If _param2 is 0\-
the initial value\-the normals are understood to be tightly packed in
the array.
The initial value is 0.
_phead(_param3)
Specifies a pointer to the first coordinate of the first normal in the
array. 
The initial value is 0.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies the location and data format of an array of normals
to use when rendering.
_param1 specifies the data type of
the normal coordinates and _param2 gives the byte stride from one
normal to the next, allowing vertices and attributes
to be packed into a single array or stored in separate arrays.
(Single-array storage may be more efficient on some implementations;
see _cmnd(InterleavedArrays).)
When a normal array is specified, _param1, _param2, and _param3 are
saved as client-side state.
.P
To enable and disable the normal array, call _cmnd(EnableClientState) and 
_cmnd(DisableClientState) with the argument _const(NORMAL_ARRAY). If
enabled, the normal array is used 
when _cmnd(DrawArrays), _cmnd(DrawElements), or _cmnd(ArrayElement) is called.
.P
Use _cmnd(DrawArrays) to construct a sequence of primitives (all of the
same type) from prespecified vertex and vertex attribute arrays.
Use _cmnd(ArrayElement) to specify primitives
by indexing vertices and vertex attributes and _cmnd(DrawElements) to
construct a sequence of primitives by indexing vertices and vertex attributes.
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
The normal array is initially disabled and isn't accessed when
_cmnd(ArrayElement), _cmnd(DrawElements), or _cmnd(DrawArrays) is called.
.P
Execution of _cmnd is not allowed between 
_cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding _cmnd(End),
but an error may or may not be generated. If an error is not generated,
the operation is undefined.
.P
_cmnd is typically implemented on the client side.
.P
Since the normal array parameters are client-side state, they are not
saved or restored by _cmnd(PushAttrib) and _cmnd(PopAttrib).
Use _cmnd(PushClientAttrib) and
_cmnd(PopClientAttrib) instead.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_ENUM) is generated if _param1 is not an accepted value.
.P
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param2 is negative.
