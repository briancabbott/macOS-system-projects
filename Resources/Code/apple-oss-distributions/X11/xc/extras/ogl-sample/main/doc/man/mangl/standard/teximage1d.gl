.SH DESCRIPTION
Texturing maps a portion of a specified texture image
onto each graphical primitive for which texturing is enabled.
To enable and disable one-dimensional texturing, call _cmnd(Enable)
and _cmnd(Disable) with argument _const(TEXTURE_1D).
.P
Texture images are defined with _cmnd.
The arguments describe the parameters of the texture image,
such as width,
width of the border,
level-of-detail number
(see _cmnd(TexParameter)),
and the internal resolution and format used to store the image.
The last three arguments describe how the image is represented in
memory; they are identical to the pixel formats used for
_cmnd(DrawPixels). 
.P
If _param1 is _const(PROXY_TEXTURE_1D), no data is read from _param8, but
all of the texture image state is recalculated, checked for
consistency, and checked against the implementation's capabilities.
If the implementation cannot handle a texture of the
requested texture size, it sets all of the image state to 0,
but does not generate an error (see _cmnd(GetError)). To query for an
entire mipmap array, use an image array level greater than or equal to
1. 
.P
If _param1 is _const(TEXTURE_1D),
data is read from _param8 as a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes,
shorts,
or longs,
or single-precision floating-point values,
depending on _param7. 
These values are grouped into sets of one,
two,
three,
or four values,
depending on _param6,
to form elements. 
If _param7 is _const(BITMAP),
the data is considered as a string of unsigned bytes
(and _param6 must be _const(COLOR_INDEX)). 
Each data byte is treated as eight 1-bit elements,
with bit ordering determined by _const(UNPACK_LSB_FIRST)
(see _cmnd(PixelStore)).
.P
The first element corresponds to the left end of the texture array.
Subsequent elements progress left-to-right through the remaining texels
in the texture array.
The final element corresponds to the right end of the texture array.
.P
_param6 determines the composition of each element in _param8.
It can assume one of eleven symbolic values:
.TP 10
_const(COLOR_INDEX)
Each element is a single value,
a color index. 
The GL converts it to fixed point
(with an unspecified number of zero bits to the right of the binary point),
shifted left or right depending on the value and sign of _const(INDEX_SHIFT),
and added to _const(INDEX_OFFSET)
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)). 
The resulting index is converted to a set of color components
using the
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R),
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G),
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B), and
_const(PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A) tables,
and clamped to the range [0,1].
.TP
_const(RED)
Each element is a single red component. 
The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
by attaching 0 for green and blue, and 1 for alpha. 
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS).  
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(GREEN)
Each element is a single green component. 
The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
by attaching 0 for red and blue, and 1 for alpha. 
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(BLUE)
Each element is a single blue component. 
The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
by attaching 0 for red and green, and 1 for alpha. 
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(ALPHA)
Each element is a single alpha component. 
The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
by attaching 0 for red, green, and blue.
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(RGB)
.TP
_const(BGR)
Each element is an RGB triple.
The GL converts it to floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element
by attaching 1 for alpha.
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(RGBA)
.TP
_const(BGRA)
_C_ .TP
_C_ _const(ABGR_EXT)
Each element contains all four components.
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(LUMINANCE)
Each element is a single luminance value.
The GL converts it to floating point,
then assembles it into an RGBA element by replicating the luminance value
three times for red, green, and blue and attaching 1 for alpha. 
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1]
(see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.TP
_const(LUMINANCE_ALPHA)
Each element is a luminance/alpha pair.
The GL converts it to floating point,
then assembles it into an RGBA element by replicating the luminance value
three times for red, green, and blue.
Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor _const(c_SCALE),
added to the signed bias _const(c_BIAS),
and clamped to the range [0,1] (see _cmnd(PixelTransfer)).
.P
If an application wants to store the texture at a certain
resolution or in a certain format, it can request the resolution
and format with _param3. The GL will choose an internal
representation that closely approximates that requested by _param3, but
it may not match exactly.
(The representations specified by _const(LUMINANCE), _const(LUMINANCE_ALPHA), _const(RGB),
and _const(RGBA) must match exactly. The numeric values 1, 2, 3, and 4 may also be used to 
specify the preceding representations.)
.P
Use the _const(PROXY_TEXTURE_1D) target to try out a resolution and
format. The implementation will
update and recompute its best match for the requested storage resolution
and format. To query this state, call _cmnd(GetTexLevelParameter).
If the texture cannot be accommodated, texture state is set to 0.
.P
A one-component texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
color from _param8. 
A two-component image uses the R and A values.
A three-component image uses the R, G, and B values.
A four-component image uses all of the RGBA components. 
.SH NOTES
Texturing has no effect in color index mode.
.P
If the _arbstring(imaging) extension is supported, RGBA elements may
also be processed by the imaging pipeline.  The following stages may be
applied to an RGBA color before color component clamping to the range
[0,\ 1]:
.TP 3
1. Color component replacement by the color table specified for
_const(COLOR_TABLE), if enabled. See _cmnd(ColorTable).
.TP
2. One-dimensional convolution filtering, if enabled. See
_cmnd(ConvolutionFilter1D).
.IP
If a convolution filter changes the __width of the texture (by
processing with a _const(CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE) of _const(REDUCE), for 
example), the _param4 must $2 sup n + 2 ( _eqnparam5 )$, for some
integer $n$, after filtering.
.TP
3. RGBA components may be multiplied by _const(POST_CONVOLUTION_c_SCALE), 
and added to _const(POST_CONVOLUTION_c_BIAS), if enabled.  See 
_cmnd(PixelTransfer).
.TP
4. Color component replacement by the color table specified for
_const(POST_CONVOLUTION_COLOR_TABLE), if enabled.  See _cmnd(ColorTable).
.TP
5. Transformation by the color matrix.  See _cmnd(MatrixMode).
.TP
6. RGBA components may be multiplied by _const(POST_COLOR_MATRIX_c_SCALE), 
and added to _const(POST_COLOR_MATRIX_c_BIAS), if enabled.  See 
_cmnd(PixelTransfer).
.TP
7. Color component replacement by the color table specified for
_const(POST_COLOR_MATRIX_COLOR_TABLE), if enabled.  See _cmnd(ColorTable).
.P
The texture image can be represented by the same data formats
as the pixels in a _cmnd(DrawPixels) command,
except that _const(STENCIL_INDEX) and _const(DEPTH_COMPONENT)
cannot be used.
_cmnd(PixelStore) and _cmnd(PixelTransfer) modes affect texture images
in exactly the way they affect _cmnd(DrawPixels).
.P
_C_ _const(ABGR_EXT) is 
_C_ part of the _extname(EXT_abgr) extension, not part of
_C_ the core GL command set.  If _extstring(EXT_abgr) is included
_C_ in the string returned by _cmnd(GetString), when called with
_C_ argument _const(EXTENSIONS), extension _extname(EXT_abgr) is
_C_ supported by the connection.
_C_ .P
_const(PROXY_TEXTURE_1D) may be used only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
Internal formats other than 1, 2, 3, or 4 may be 
used only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.P
In GL version 1.1 or greater, 
_param8 may be a null pointer. In this case texture memory is
allocated to accommodate a texture of width _param4. 
You can then download subtextures to initialize the
texture memory. The image is undefined if the program tries to apply
an uninitialized portion of the texture image to a primitive.
.P
Formats _const(BGR), and _const(BGRA) and types
_const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2),
_const(UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV),
_const(UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5),

_const(UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2), and
_const(UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV) are available only if the GL version 
is 1.2 or greater.
.P
When the _arbstring(multitexture) extension is supported, _cmnd
specifies the one-dimensional texture for the current texture unit,
specified with _cmnd(ActiveTextureARB).
