.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the quadrics object (created with _cmnd(NewQuadric)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the inner radius of the disk (may be 0).
_phead(_param3)
Specifies the outer radius of the disk.
_phead(_param4)
Specifies the number of subdivisions around the \f2z\fP axis.
_phead(_param5)
Specifies the number of concentric rings about the origin into which
the disk is subdivided.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd renders a disk on the \f2z\fP = 0 plane. The disk has a radius of 
_param3, and contains a concentric circular hole with a radius 
of _param2. If _param2 is 0, then no hole is generated. The disk is
subdivided around the \f2z\fP axis into slices (like pizza slices), and also
about the \f2z\fP axis into rings 
(as specified by _param4 and _param5, respectively).
.P
With respect to orientation, the +\f2z\fP side of the disk is considered to be 
"outside" (see _cmnd(QuadricOrientation)).
This means that if the
orientation is set to _gluconst(OUTSIDE), then any normals generated 
point along the +\f2z\fP axis. Otherwise, they point along the \-\f2z\fP 
axis.
.P
If texturing has been turned on (with _cmnd(QuadricTexture)), 
texture coordinates are generated
linearly such that where $ r ~=~ _eqnparam3 $, the value at (\f2r\fP, 0, 0) is 
(1, 0.5), at (0, \f2r\fP, 0) it is (0.5, 1), at (\-\f2r\fP, 0, 0) 
it is (0, 0.5), and 
at (0, \-\f2r\fP, 0) it is (0.5, 0).
