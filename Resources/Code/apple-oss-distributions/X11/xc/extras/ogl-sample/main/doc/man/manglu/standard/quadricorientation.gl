.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the quadrics object (created with _cmnd(NewQuadric)).
_phead(_param2)
Specifies the desired orientation. Valid values are
_gluconst(OUTSIDE) and
_gluconst(INSIDE).
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies what kind of orientation is desired for quadrics rendered 
with _param1. The _param2 values are as follows:
.TP 15
_gluconst(OUTSIDE) 
Quadrics are drawn with normals pointing outward (the initial value).
.TP
_gluconst(INSIDE) 
Quadrics are drawn with normals pointing inward.
.P
Note that the interpretation of \f2outward\fP and \f2inward\fP depends on the
quadric being drawn.
