.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the integer name of the display list to be executed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd causes the named display list to be executed.
The commands saved in the display list are executed in order,
just as if they were called without using a display list.
If _param1 has not been defined as a display list,
_cmnd is ignored.
.P
_cmnd can appear inside a display list.
To avoid the possibility of infinite recursion resulting from display lists
calling one another,
a limit is placed on the nesting level of display
lists during display-list execution.
This limit is at least 64, and it depends on the implementation.
.P
GL state is not saved and restored across a call to _cmnd.
Thus,
changes made to GL state during the execution of a display list
remain after execution of the display list is completed.
Use _cmnd(PushAttrib),
_cmnd(PopAttrib),
_cmnd(PushMatrix),
and _cmnd(PopMatrix) to preserve GL state across _cmnd calls.
.SH NOTES
Display lists can be executed between a call to _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding call to _cmnd(End),
as long as the display list includes only commands that are allowed
in this interval.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
_cmnd(Get) with argument _const(MAX_LIST_NESTING)
