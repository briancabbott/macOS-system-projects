.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the number of texture names to be generated.
_phead(_param2)
Specifies an array in which the generated texture names are stored.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd returns _param1 texture names in _param2.
There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers;
however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use
immediately before the call to _cmnd.
.P
The generated textures have no dimensionality; they assume the dimensionality
of the texture target to which they are first bound
(see _cmnd(BindTexture)).
.P
Texture names returned by a call to _cmnd are not returned by
subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
_cmnd(DeleteTextures).
.SH NOTES
_cmnd is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_VALUE) is generated if _param1 is negative.
.P
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd is executed
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding
execution of _cmnd(End).
