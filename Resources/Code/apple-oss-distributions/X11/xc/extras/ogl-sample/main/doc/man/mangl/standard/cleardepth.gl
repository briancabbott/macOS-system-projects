.SH PARAMETERS
_phead(_param1)
Specifies the depth value used when the depth buffer is cleared. The
initial value is 1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
_cmnd specifies the depth value used by _cmnd(Clear) to clear the depth buffer.
Values specified by _cmnd are clamped to the range [0,\ 1].
.SH ERRORS
_const(INVALID_OPERATION) is generated if _cmnd
is executed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin)
and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).
