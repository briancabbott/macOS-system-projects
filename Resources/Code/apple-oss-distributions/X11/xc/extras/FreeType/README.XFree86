A few files in this directory and all the files in the `lib/'
subdirectory come from the FreeType 1.3.1 distribution.  Please consult

Those files have been slightly modified.  All the changes are marked
with a comment saying `Xserver-specific'.


When importing version A.B of FreeType, use:

 cvs import -m "FreeType version A.B" xc/extras/FreeType FreeType FreeType-A_B


Files that are modified relative to the most recent import should have
the ident text: $XFree86: xc/extras/FreeType/README.XFree86,v 1.3 2000/02/13 06:15:21 dawes Exp $ added in a comment.
