XCOMM You may need to modify the following DEFINES variable as follows:
XCOMM if your system doesn't provide strcasecmp add -DNEED_STRCASECMP
XCOMM if your system doesn't provide strdup add -DNEED_STRDUP
XCOMM if your system doesn't provide pipe add -DNO_ZPIPE
XCOMM if on your system sprintf doesn't return the number of bytes transmitted
XCOMM add -DVOID_SPRINTF

#if defined(UltrixArchitecture) || \
    (defined(MipsArchitecture) && !defined(SGIArchitecture))
STRDUPDEF = -DNEED_STRDUP
#else
# if defined(Win32Architecture) || defined(USLArchitecture) || \
     (defined(HasStrcasecmp) && !HasStrcasecmp)
STRCASECMPDEF = -DNEED_STRCASECMP
# else
#  if defined(SunArchitecture) && !defined(SVR4Architecture)
SPRINTFDEF = -DVOID_SPRINTF
#  endif
# endif
#endif
#if defined(Win32Architecture)
ZPIPEDEF = -DNO_ZPIPE
#endif

DEFINES = $(STRDUPDEF) $(STRCASECMPDEF) $(SPRINTFDEF) $(ZPIPEDEF)

XCOMM You can uncomment the following line to avoid building the shared lib
XCOMM IMAKE_DEFINES = -DSharedLibXpm=NO

XCOMM Normally the following part should not need to be edited

#define PassCDebugFlags "CDEBUGFLAGS=$(CDEBUGFLAGS)" "DEFINES=$(DEFINES)"

     SUBDIRS = lib sxpm cxpm
