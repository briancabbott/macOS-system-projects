.SH NAME
xcursorgen \- create an X cursor file from a collection of PNG images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "xcursorgen"
.RI [ config-file ]
.RI [ output-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Xcursorgen reads the config-file to find the list of cursor images along
with their hotspot and nominal size information.  Xcursorgen converts all of
the images to Xcursor format and writes them to the output-file.
.P
Each line in the config file is of the form:
.br
<size> <xhot> <yhot> <filename> <ms-delay>
.br
.P
Multiple images with the same <size> are used to create animated cursors,
the <ms-delay> value on each line indicates how long each image should be
displayed before switching to the next.  <ms-delay> can be elided for static
cursors.
