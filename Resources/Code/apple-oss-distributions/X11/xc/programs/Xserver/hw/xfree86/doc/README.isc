1.  X11R6/XFree86 on Interactive Unix

This document provides some additional information about compiling and using
X11R6 and XFree86 on your Interactive Unix, also referred to as ISC.

If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or ideas regarding X11R6/XFree86
on Interactive Unix, send e-mail to

<michael.rohleder@stadt-frankfurt.de>

Bug Reports should be sent to

<XFree86@XFree86.Org>

Questions or anything else should be posted to the NewsGroup

comp.windows.x.i386unix

There is currently no support for shared Libraries so it will be filespace
consuming if you want to build X11-clients with X11R6. Best you mix X11R6
Server with X11R5 and X11R4 clients. And only compile clients who need the
new facilities provided in the X11R6 Libraries against them.

     Please note:
            XFree86 Version 4.0 will be the last version which is known
            to compile on Interactive Unix.
            I've only tested this version on Interactive Unix, Version 4.1mu.

2.  Things needed for compiling the sources

      gcc
            Use the highest number for x you found.  Fresco will only build
            2.6.3 and later.  I'd tried gcc Version 2.5.8, 2.6.0, 2.6.2,
            2.6.3 and 2.7.2.  Current: 2.8.1

            Since 2.6.3 the current source tree should be able to compile
            with a little bit more Optimization:
             #define DefaultCDebugFlags -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer inside
            xf86site.def to overwrite the default -O2.

            With 2.7.x you must specify #define UsePosix               YES
            inside xf86site.def.  This is necessary to build the sources suc-
            cessfully.  Versions prior to 2.7.0 could define it, but don't
            need it for a clean build.

            With 2.8.1 on Pentium CPU we can use special 586 Optimization.
            Try the following define inside your host.def.

                           #define DefaultGcc2i386Opt    \
                                     -O2 -march=pentium -mpentium -Wall -Wno-implicit-int \
                                     -fno-strength-reduce
                           /* default with 2.8.1, so not really needed
                              -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2
                           */

      libg++-2.x.x
            The needed g++ Libraries for use with g++ 2.x.x. As this is only
            necessary for Fresco, it isn't needed anymore since X11R6.1.

      binutils
            You could use the assembler and linker the assembler is most pre-
            ferred,and the linker is needed at least if you want to link
            libFresco.a within a Program.  Don't use strip and ar/ranlib, the
            first generates buggy binaries when stripping (at least on my
            machines) and the last requires the use of ranlib after creating
            an archive, this is not configured.  Current: 2.8.1.0.15 (Used:
            as, ld, ar, strip)

      gnu-malloc
            Due to better memory usage we should use GNU's malloc library on
            systems where possible.

            Enable #define UseGnuMalloc YES inside xf86site.def or within the
            Linkkit site.def.

            Enable and set #define GnuMallocLibrary to your needs, if it
            isn't like the default -L/usr/local/lib -lgmalloc.

      inline-math (optional)
            This is the "original" inline-math package available at your
            favorite Linux Mirror.

            Use #define UseInlineMath YES inside host.def to enable it.
            Please note the changes section what else to do, to use this
            package.

3.  Changes to the System Header Files

You have to change some of the standard header files supplied with your ver-
sion of Interactive. You also need to change some of the include files in the
gcc-lib/include directory.

Let us say the gcc-files are in directory

/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i[345]86-isc[34].[0-9]/2.6.x

referred to as "gcc-lib"

3.1  /usr/include/sys/limits.h

and gcc-lib/include/sys/limits.h

               #ifndef OPEN_MAX
               #ifdef ISC
               #define OPEN_MAX        256
               #else
               #define OPEN_MAX        20
               #endif
               #endif

OPEN_MAX had to be increased to prevent Xlib Errors (max no. of clients
reached).

3.2  /usr/include/sys/ioctl.h

surrounded by

             #ifndef _IOCTL_H
             #define _IOCTL_H
             ...
             #endif

to prevent multiple includes.

3.3  /usr/include/errno.h

(and the corresponding gcc-include-file) add

             #include <net/errno.h>

because of EWOULDBLOCK undefined in several places regarding lbx.  Surround
/usr/include/net/errno.h with

             #ifndef _NET_ERRNO_H
             #define _NET_ERRNO_H
             ...
             #endif

to prevent multiple includes were <net/errno.h> is explicit included from the
sources.

3.4  /usr/include/rpc/types.h

copy this file to gcc-lib/include/rpc/types.h and change the declaration of
malloc() to

              #if !defined(__cplusplus)
              extern char *malloc();
              #endif

Note that this is only necessary if you want to build Fresco

3.5  /usr/include/sys/un.h

such a file does not exist on Interactive. You may like to generate it, if
you don't like a warning from depend. It isn't needed to compile the sources
successfully.

You could use the following to produce it:

              #ifndef X_NO_SYS_UN
              struct  sockaddr_un {
                      short   sun_family;             /* AF_UNIX */
                      char    sun_path[108];          /* path name (gag) */
              };
              #endif

3.6  /usr/include/math.h

To use the Inline Math package you have to change your existing math.h.
Please note, the way I include the new Header file, is different than sug-
gested in inline-math's README.

Please add the following at the bottom of math.h, before the last #endif

     #if defined(UseInlineMath)

     /* Needed on ISC __CONCAT, PI */
     #ifndef __CONCAT
     /*
      * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
      * with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
      * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
      * in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
      * strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.
      */
     #if defined(__STDC__) || defined(__cplusplus)
     #define __CONCAT(x,y)   x ## y
     #define __STRING(x)     #x
     #else   /* !(__STDC__ || __cplusplus) */
     #define __CONCAT(x,y)   x/**/y
     #define __STRING(x)     "x"
     #endif  /* !(__STDC__ || __cplusplus) */
     #endif

     #ifndef PI
     #define PI M_PI
     #endif

     #include "/usr/local/include/i386/__math.h"
     #endif

4.  make World

     BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="-DISC [-DISC30 | -DISC40] -DSYSV [-Di386]"

      -DISC -DISC30
            these two defines are necessary to build the release I don't know
            if the build will succeed for ISC versions prior than 3.x

      -DISC40
            are only for getting the ISC version and therefore set the Has-
            SymLinks to Yes ('cause symbolic linking were only supported from
            Version 4.x using the S5L Filesystem)

            If you could use long filenames, you could enable the installa-
            tion of expanded Manual Pages by including
             #define ExpandManNames  YES inside xf86site.def.

            A build on ISC 4.x only needs -DISC40 defined in the BOOT-
            STRAPCFLAGS ( -DISC30 will be included automatically ).

            Note: due to some incompatibilities between ISC 4.0 and 4.1, the
            default is to build for ISC4.0, even if you build on 4.1.  If you
            want to build only for 4.1 you should set  #define IscCompileVer-
            sion       410  inside your host.def.

            (the fchmod function isn't available on 4.0, so it won't compile,
            and binaries from 4.1 won't run cause of the unsupported System
            call The libraries build for 4.1 couldn't be used with 4.0 Sys-
            tems, due to some functions not available on 4.0)

      -DSYSV [-Di386]
            standard defines for SystemV Release3 on x86 platform.  You don't
            need to explicitly define -Di386 because this is pre-defined in
            /lib/cpp.

5.  linear Addressing

   o Compiling ...

     You need the mmap-2.2.3 driver installed on your system.  If you don't
     have the mmap-2.2.3 driver installed, you could use the driver source in
     the file

          xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/etc/mmapSVR3.shar

     or

          /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/mmapSVR3.shar

     Build and install the driver as instructed. You'll need the file
     /usr/include/sys/mmap.h for compiling the X11R6/XFree86 source tree,
     with linear addressing enabled.

          The new loadable X Server is not tested to work without linear addressing.

   o Using ...

     To use the linear address-mapping of the framebuffer you need the mmap
     Driver by Thomas Wolfram (Version 2.2.3) installed in your Kernel.  If
     you have installed it, most servers will use linear addressing by
     default.  Others may require setting the

          Option "linear"

     in your XF86Config.   Check the appropriate manual pages for details.
     Maybe you need also the MemBase specified in XF86Config. Please refer to
     the appropriate README of your Card/Server, for How to use...

     I could only test these cards on Interactive UNIX

        o Spea/V7 Vega - clgd5428 - VLB - (old)

          with 32MB MainMemory installed I couldn't use it.  My tests with
          different mappings into the address space results in no Graphics
          displayed or a spontaneous reboot.

        o ATI GUP      - mach32   - VLB - (old)

          with 32MB MainMemory installed I could map the CardMemory at Mem-
          Base 0x07c00000. I could work with all clients until I try to acti-
          vate a Motif 1.1.1 InputField inside a Motif Client like Mosaic-2.4
          or xplan. This results in a crash of the XServer.

                          !!! You could work around this !!!

          Expand your .Xdefaults with

                          *blinkRate:             0
                          *cursorPositionVisible: false

          This bug seems to be fixed since 3.1.2, and therefore the
          workaround is not needed anymore.

        o ELSA Winner 2000PRO/X Revision G

          if you experience a Problem with this Card you could try to use the
          older Chipset Driver instead "newmmio".

          If you declare

                          Chipset "mmio_928"

          inside your XF86Config, it may be alright again.

          With the current XF86_S3 I don't encounter any problem.

        o Diamond FireGL 1000

                       3Dlabs GLINT Permedia rev 1
                       3Dlabs GLINT Delta rev 1

6.  Multibuffer Extension

This is an obsolete Extension. Anyway, if you want to include this Extension
inside your build, you have to add: #define BuildMultibuffer        YES
inside xf86site.def Please note, this Extension should be disabled when
building the Loader Server.

7.  Default Definitions

These are default options defined inside isc.cf.  You can redefine them
inside host.def.

Here is a sample host.def (the one I use for XFree86 4.0):

     /* Disable the use of /var/X11  and /etc/X11 */
     #define HasVarDirectory         NO
     #define UseEtcX11               NO

     /* Use inline Math from linux ;-) package inline-math-2.6.tar.gz */
     /* should be available on your favorite linux ftp                */
     # define UseInlineMath        YES

     /* Use cbrt from liboptm.a (Interactive icc Compiler) */
     # define HasCbrt         YES

     /* Use GNUs MallocLibrary (and the Location for the Lib)             */
     # define UseGnuMalloc         YES

     /* Expand Manual Pages (needs S5L)                                   */
     # define ExpandManNames       YES

     /* if you have groff or the TextProcessingWorkbench - don't preformat*/
     # define FormattedManPages      NO

     /* XF86Setup Util */
     # define HasTk           YES
     # define HasTcl               YES

     /* use doctools */
     # define HasSgmlFmt             YES
     # define BuildAllDocs            YES
     # define BuildLinuxDocText       NO
     # define BuildLinuxDocPS         NO

     #define GlxBuiltInMesa         YES

8.  Installation

After your make World BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="... succeed,

     make install

to install in /usr/X11R6. Make sure you have enough space, and /usr/X11R6
exists either as a directory or a symlink to another directory maybe in
another filesystem.

     make install.man

to install the compressed nroff versions of the manual pages into
/usr/X11R6/man. This directory will be generated if it doesn't exist.

            You should tune the Kernel using the command-file

            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/xf86install

            This will increase the available pseudo devices,
            some Tunable Parameters and install some files
            to use inside sysadm. You could also install
            some additional Fonts and Terminal files.

This is now a menu driven config tool for XFree86 on IUS For the first setup
you should go from 1 to x step by step.  Here is its main screen

     X11R6 XFree86 Version (version)

     Your Choice [1-9]?<enter>:

You also should increase MAXUMEM to its maximum, else programs may die with:

     X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
       Major opcode of failed request:  53 (X_CreatePixmap)
       Serial number of failed request:  37791
       Current serial number in output stream:  37822
       Widget hierarchy of resource: unknown

You could do this automatically with menu entry no. 5.

9.  Using ...

   o Xprt:

     The new Xprint Server is configured to use lpr as its print helper so
     you have to install and configure lpr to use Xprt.

   o xpcterm:

     if you want to get the German 'Umlaut' inside your ISC X11R4 client xpc-
     term when you are using the ega/vga font. Set up the user's .Xdefaults
     to contain:

                   XEga*AT386.Translations: #override \
                             Shift<Key>odiaeresis: string(0x99) \n\
                                  <Key>odiaeresis: string(0x94) \n\
                             Shift<Key>adiaeresis: string(0x8e) \n\
                                  <Key>adiaeresis: string(0x84) \n\
                             Shift<Key>udiaeresis: string(0x9a) \n\
                                  <Key>udiaeresis: string(0x81) \n\
                             Shift<Key>ssharp: string(0x3f) \n\
                              Meta<Key>ssharp: string(0x5c)  \n\
                                  <Key>ssharp: string(0xe1)

     The only disadvantage is that you have to use Alt instead of AltGr to
     get the \ Backslash (on a German Keyboard)

     You have to call your xpcterm with the option -name XEga -fn ega

   o Switching between X11R5 and X11R6 configuration

     to compile X11-Clients as either R6 or R5 clients, should be as easy as
     you only switch the PATH components so that either /usr/X11R6/bin/xmkmf
     or /usr/X386/bin/xmkmf would make the new Makefile.

   o ISC Streams Pipes

     The old path to the pipes on ISC's R4 /tmp/.X11-unix has changed to
     /dev/X/ISCCONN. For compatibility reasons on ISC, the pipes in the new
     directory will be linked to a file inside the old.  This will normally
     be a hard link, so it can't go across filesystems. On ISC Version 4.x
     this is now allowed. But you should use the new S5L on both filesystems.
     ISC30 systems should take care that the two directories are on the same
     FS. Else if you are using a ISC40 compiled binary, the Server could
     maybe abort due to a SIGSYS.  We tried to catch this signal, so if it
     dumps please send me a note.

   o Warnings you may see:

        o Since 3.2A, you could see a warning from pre X11R6.3 clients.

                          Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset

          The case are the new gzipped fonts, but the Warning isn't serious.

        o If you start a server you may see the following message:

                       _XSERVTransOpen: transport open failed for named/enigma:0
                       _XSERVTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: failed to open listener for named

          This message either isn't critical. Interactive doesn't support
          this kind of connection.
