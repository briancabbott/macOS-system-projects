1.  Supported hardware

This driver supports a single chipset `mediagx' that should work on the fol-
lowing Cyrix CPUs with integrated graphics:

   o MediaGX

   o MediaGXi

   o MediaGXm

2.  Features

   o Rather sparse (color depth hardcoded to 8)

3.  XF86Config Option

      Option "sw_cursor"
            disable the hardware cursor. (Code not verified yet!)

      Option "no_accel"
            completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.

4.  Bugs and Limitations

   o As a first cut at the new design, known problems are everywhere.  The
     console font is corrupted upon exit.  The server seems stable if the
     virtual desktop and resolution size match.  I found 1024x768 usable and
     that's why I released this version.  Geeks can have fun with this but
     NEWBIES should use the 3.3.3.1 release instead!

   o On some older chipsets, the driver may trigger an illegal instruction
     just after probing for the ``scratchpad size''.  If this is the case,
     email to <hecker@cat.dfrc.nasa.gov> with the output of

          XFree86 -probeonly -verbose

     and this will be fixed.
