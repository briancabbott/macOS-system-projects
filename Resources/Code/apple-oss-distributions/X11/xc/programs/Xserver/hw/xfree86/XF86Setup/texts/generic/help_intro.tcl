set message "\n\
	You need to fill in the requested information on each\
	of the five\n\
	configuration screens.  The buttons along the top allow\
	you to choose which\n\
	screen you are going to work on.  You can do them in\
	any order or go back\n\
	to each of them as many times as you like, however,\
	it will be very\n\
	difficult to use some of them if your mouse is not\
	working, so you\n\
	should configure your mouse first.\n\n\
	Until you get your mouse working, here are some keys you\
	can use:\n\n\
	\ \ Tab, Ctrl-Tab    Move to the \"next\" widget\n\
	\ \ Shift-Tab        Move to the \"previous\" widget\n\
	\ \ <Arrow keys>     Move in the appropriate direction\n\
	\ \ Return           Activate the selected widget\n\n\
	Also, you can press Alt and one of the underlined letters\
	to activate the\n\
	corresponding button."
