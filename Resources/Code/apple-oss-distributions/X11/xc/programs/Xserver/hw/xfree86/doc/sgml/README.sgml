<abstract>

XFree86 is an Open Source version of the X Window System that supports
many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other platforms.  This
version is compatible with X11R6.6.

<sect>What is XFree86 &relvers;?
<p>

<![ %updaterel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to &fullrelvers;,
the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
XFree86 4.x series.

Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are
updating.  They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly
fixes for security issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve
stability.
]]>

<![ %fullrel [
XFree86 &relvers; is the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
XFree86 4.x series.
]]>

<![ %snapshot [
XFree86 &relvers; is a pre-release snapshot of XFree86 &nextfullrelvers;.
<![ %relcandidate [
This snapshot is release candidate &rcnum; for version &nextfullrelvers;.
]]>
Pre-release snapshots are provided for beta testing.  You should only install
snapshots if you're comfortable dealing with possibly unstable beta-level
software.  If you find problems with this snapshot, you are encouraged
to report your findings to the public XFree86 mailing list:
<email>XFree86@XFree86.org</email>.

XFree86 &relvers; is a feature-complete snapshot of XFree86
&nextfullrelvers;.
]]> 

<p>
XFree86 4.x is the current XFree86 release series.  The first release in
this series was in early 2000.  The core of XFree86 4.x is a modular
X server.
<![ %fullrel [The &relvers; version is a new release that includes
additional hardware support, functional enhancements and bug fixes.]]>
<![ %haverelnotes [
Specific release enhancements can be viewed in the
<htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES.html">.
]]>

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in XFree86 &relvers;, and
most PC video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with
the "vesa" driver.  The <htmlurl name="Driver Status document"
url="Status.html"> has a summary of what hardware is supported in
&relvers; compared with the old 3.3.x (&legacyvers;) series.  It is a
good idea to check there before upgrading if you are currently running
&legacyvers; with older hardware.

XFree86 is produced by The XFree86 Project, Inc, which is a group of
mostly volunteer independent developers.  XFree86 is a non-commercial
organisation, and would not be viable without the invaluable development
contributions of volunteers.  This release is dedicated to all who have
supported and contributed to XFree86 over the last eleven years.

url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/">,

<htmlurl name="Installation Document" url="Install.html">.  Information about
obtaining the release in source form is given below.
]]>

<![ %updaterel; [
The source for version &relvers; is available as a patch relative to
&prevrelvers;.
The patch file is <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.

The patch
should be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree, working from
the directory containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The patch should
be applied by running:

<tscreen><verb>
gzip -d &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>

Information about getting the source for &prevrelvers can be found in the
README file for that version, which can be found on the
<url name="XFree86 web site" url="http://www.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&prevrelvers;/README.html">.
]]>

<![ %fullrel [
The source for version &fullrelvers; is split into seven tarballs:
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-1.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-2.tgz</tt>,
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-3.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-4.tgz</tt>,
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-5.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-6.tgz</tt> and
<tt>X&fullsrcvers;src-7.tgz</tt>.  The first three contain everything
except the fonts and general X11 documentation.  Those three are sufficient
for building XFree86 if you already have a set of fonts.  The fourth
and fifth contain the fonts.  The sixth contains the source for the
general X11 documentation.  The seventh contains the general X11
documentation in hardcopy format.

<sect>Reporting Bugs
<p>

Bugs should be reported to <email>XFree86@XFree86.org</email>.  Before
reporting bugs, please check the XFree86 server log file, which can be
found at <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> on most platforms.  If you
can't resolve the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your
bug report but not the operating system core dump.  Do not edit  the
log file as our developers use it to reproduce and debug your problem.
