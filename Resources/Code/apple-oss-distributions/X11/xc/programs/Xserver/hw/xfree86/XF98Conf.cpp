    Load	"pex5"

XCOMM This loads the XIE extension module.

    Load	"xie"

XCOMM This loads the GLX extension module.

    Load	"glx"

XCOMM This loads the DBE extension module.

    Load	"dbe"

XCOMM This loads the RECORD extension module.

    Load	"record"

XCOMM This loads the miscellaneous extensions module, and disables
XCOMM initialisation of the XFree86-DGA extension within that module.

XCOMM Server flags section.  This contains various server-wide Options.
XCOMM **********************************************************************

Section "ServerFlags"

XCOMM Uncomment this to cause a core dump at the spot where a signal is 
XCOMM received.  This may leave the console in an unusable state, but may
XCOMM provide a better stack trace in the core dump to aid in debugging

XCOMM    Option	"NoTrapSignals"

XCOMM Uncomment this to disable the <Crtl><Alt><BS> server abort sequence
XCOMM This allows clients to receive this key event.

XCOMM    Option	"DontZap"

XCOMM Uncomment this to disable the <Crtl><Alt><KP_+>/<KP_-> mode switching
XCOMM sequences.  This allows clients to receive these key events.

XCOMM    Option	"DontZoom"

XCOMM Uncomment this to disable tuning with the xvidtune client. With
XCOMM it the client can still run and fetch card and monitor attributes,
XCOMM but it will not be allowed to change them. If it tries it will
XCOMM receive a protocol error.

XCOMM    Option	"DisableVidModeExtension"

XCOMM Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local xvidtune client.

XCOMM    Option	"AllowNonLocalXvidtune"

XCOMM Uncomment this to disable dynamically modifying the input device
XCOMM (mouse and keyboard) settings.

XCOMM    Option	"DisableModInDev"

XCOMM Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local client to
XCOMM change the keyboard or mouse settings (currently only xset).

XCOMM    Option	"AllowNonLocalModInDev"

XCOMM Set the basic blanking screen saver timeout.

    Option	"blank time"	"10"	# 10 minutes

XCOMM Set the DPMS timeouts.  These are set here because they are global
XCOMM rather than screen-specific.  These settings alone don't enable DPMS.
XCOMM It is enabled per-screen (or per-monitor), and even then only when
XCOMM the driver supports it.

    Option	"standby time"	"20"
    Option	"suspend time"	"30"
    Option	"off time"	"60"

XCOMM Specify PC98 architecture

XCOMM    Option	"PC98"

XCOMM the following instead of any of the lines above.  The Device line
XCOMM is not required in this case.

XCOMM The VendorName and ModelName lines are optional.
    VendorName	"Unknown"

XCOMM HorizSync is in kHz unless units are specified.
XCOMM HorizSync may be a comma separated list of discrete values, or a
XCOMM comma separated list of ranges of values.
XCOMM NOTE: THE VALUES HERE ARE EXAMPLES ONLY.  REFER TO YOUR MONITOR'S
XCOMM USER MANUAL FOR THE CORRECT NUMBERS.

    HorizSync	31.5  # typical for a single frequency fixed-sync monitor

XCOMM    HorizSync	30-64         # multisync
XCOMM    HorizSync	31.5, 35.2    # multiple fixed sync frequencies
XCOMM    HorizSync	15-25, 30-50  # multiple ranges of sync frequencies

XCOMM VertRefresh is in Hz unless units are specified.
XCOMM VertRefresh may be a comma separated list of discrete values, or a
XCOMM comma separated list of ranges of values.
XCOMM NOTE: THE VALUES HERE ARE EXAMPLES ONLY.  REFER TO YOUR MONITOR'S
XCOMM USER MANUAL FOR THE CORRECT NUMBERS.

    VertRefresh	60  # typical for a single frequency fixed-sync monitor

XCOMM    VertRefresh	60, 65        # multiple fixed sync frequencies
XCOMM    VertRefresh	40-50, 80-100 # multiple ranges of sync frequencies

XCOMM Modes can be specified in two formats.  A compact one-line format, or
XCOMM a multi-line format.

XCOMM A generic VGA 640x480 mode (hsync = 31.5kHz, refresh = 60Hz)
XCOMM These two are equivalent

XCOMM    ModeLine "640x480" 25.175 640 664 760 800 480 491 493 525

XCOMM If a monitor has DPMS support, that can be indicated here.  This will
XCOMM enable DPMS when the monitor is used with drivers that support it.

XCOMM    Option	"dpms"

XCOMM If a monitor requires that the sync signals be superimposed on the
XCOMM green signal, the following option will enable this when used with
XCOMM drivers that support it.  Only a relatively small range of hardware
XCOMM (and drivers) actually support this.

XCOMM    Option	"sync on green"
