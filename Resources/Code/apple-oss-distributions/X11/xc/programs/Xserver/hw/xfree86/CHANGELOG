      key sequences and the HandleSpecialKeys config option (#5653, Joe Moss).
 960. Move the XF86_DATE definition to a separate file so that bumping it
      doesn't trigger almost everything to be rebuilt (David Dawes).
 959. Xterm patch #174 (Thomas Dickey).
 958. Fix a bug that was preventing DGA2 acceleration from being advertised
      by the i810 driver (David Dawes).
 957. Fix an "xtt" font backend module crash that shows up on Linux/PPC,
      related to an invalid code converter module being loaded because of
      a broken string comparison in xttconv.c (#A.1647, Chisato Yamauchi,
      Daisuke MASATSUNA).
 956. Fix a NULL dereference that can happen in lcGenConv.c (#A.1646,

      combos for exponent characters, katakana voiced sounds, etc to
      the en_US.UTF-8 compose file (#5646, David Monniaux).
 951. Reinstate the VBEInit() call in the savage driver's PreInit().  This
      appears to fix a problem on some Savage MX platforms (#5649,
      Mike Harris).
 950. Restore the radeon driver's unconditional RADEONPreInt10Save() call
      on Alpha platforms because this is needed for Radeon cards where the
      BIOS ROM can't be read after it's been run once (by the firmware)
      without this (#5648, Jeff Wiedemeier).
 949. Update Newport driver doc (#5647, Guido Guenther).
 948. Fix reversed logic for VGA locking/unlocking (Nat Ersoz).
 947. Luit fixes:
       - Fix a bug with --encoding being too strict with the syntax.
       - Add a -x flag that causes luit to exit as soon as the child does.
       - Update the man page to synchronise with Tomohiro's work on XTerm.
      (#5643, Juliusz Chroboczek).
 946. Fix some endianness bugs in the r200 DRI driver, and guard a debugging
      print message (Michel Dänzer).
 945. Fix radeon HW cursor artifacts when switching between 2-color and

 941. Fix a problem where a malformed Ximage can cause Xcursor to step
      outside the image data (#A.1636, Keith Packard, reported by
      Michel Dänzer).
 940. Allow xf86setjmp/xf86setlongjmp to work with platforms where
      setjmp() isn't directly available as a function, specifically Linux
      platforms that use glibc 2.0 and 2.1. (David Dawes, Keith Packard).
 939. Check pScrn->vtSema before calling xf86SetCursor() from
      xf86CursorCloseScreen().  This avoids a segfault at exit with some
      drivers (Alan Hourihane).
 938. Fix adding FP native mode for Radeon (Hui Yu@ATI, Kevin Martin).
 937. Initialize I2C when primary head has an invalid DDC type for the

      when a map that uses the ThirdLevel virtual modifier is not the first
      layout in a multi-layout configuration (#5642, Ivan Pascal).
 933. Use safe values in the Thai XIM which should work regardless of
      the signedness of XIMStringConversionPosition (#A.1628,
      Theppitak Karoonboonyanan).
 932. Replace xf86setjmp/xf86setlongjmp with symbol aliases that resolve
      directly to the native libc versions so that they can operate in
      modules, and make xf86jmp_buf much larger so that should be big enough
      for any reasonable CPU/OS combination.  This should fix problems
      with the Freetype2-based freetype font module (#A.1625, Keith Packard).
 931. Change the default base symbols map from pc104 to pc105, which should
      fix most cases where the <LSGT> key isn't defined.  Also change the
      default XkbModel from pc101 to pc105 (Ivan Pascal).
 930. Fix run-time enabling/disabling of VT switching via xf86EnableVTSwitch()
      (David Dawes).
 929. Add a "DontVTSwitch" option to allow VT switching to be disabled
      (on platforms where the X server initiates VT switches) (#5640,
      Branden Robinson).
 928. Fix a memory leak in _XimExtension() (#5638, MINAMI Hirokazu).
 927. Fix hard-coded ProjectRoot paths in the proxymngr man page (#5634,
      Branden Robinson).
 926. Fix a NULL pointer dereference in the fontenc library (#5633, Debian).

      when multiple threads attempt to initialize the Xcursor library
      simultaneously (#A.1623, Keith Packard).
 923. Fix xvidtune to pop up a info window if mode on chipset is
      not tuneable (Egbert Eich).
 922. Fix a NULL pointer in a var_arg list in xfd which causes problems
      on 64 bit systems (Egbert Eich).
 921. Fix a typo in the nsc Imakefile when installing the linkkit 
      (#A.1624, Stanislav Brabec).
 920. Remove a dependency on how Xlib buffers requests internally for
      xtest's test 2 of XSync (Keith Packard).
 919. Fix a bug in the way the bitmap font code calculates mix/max bounds
      (it was ignoring empty characters), which fixes some xtest fonts
      bounds check failures (Keith Packard).
 918. Check that the HW cursor has been setup before calling
      xf86ForceHWCursor() in the radeon (and r128) driver.  This fixes
      crashes when using only the SW cursor (#5628, Michel Dänzer).
 917. Fix duplicate arguments for xf86MatchPciInstances() in the DESIGN doc
      (#5627, Guido Guenther).

      layer's check for mis-configured PCI-to-PCI bridges (Marc La France).
 913. Fix bug that would sometimes cause an extra hardware cursor to re-appear
      on a secondary head after a server reset (Marc La France).
 912. Protect "cvl" references in recent changes to _XEventsQueued() with
      '#ifdef XTHREADS' (reported by Dan Holm).

 911. Change the newport driver to use ShadowFBInit2 to fix the broken
      "switching back from the console" issue, and update the driver's man
      page (#5625, Guido Guenther).
 910. SCO doc update (#5624, J. Kean Johnston).
 909. Fix X11.tmpl so that Fontconfig works correctly if an OS.cf file
      sets HasFontconfig, and do this in sco5.cf (#5624, J. Kean Johnston).

      Knut J Bjuland).
 904. Fix a problem in _XEventsQueued() that causes an event reader lock
      of another thread to be released.  This can cause a hang and keyboard
      lockup in KDE (#5619, Ewald Snel).
 903. Fix some bugs with Xft drawing to non-Render enabled servers:
       - Drawing monochrome glyphs had an infinite loop.
       - XftGlyphSpecCore failed to render some glyphs, leading to application
         crashes from uninitialized values.
       (#A.1608, Keith Packard, reported by Nalin Dahyabhai).
 902. Fix the <BKSL> key in the "winkeys" variants of the Russian and
      Ukrainian XKB maps (#5624, Leon Kanter).
 901. Install the XKB README files (#5623, Ivan Pascal).

      (Leif Delgass).
 897. Fix the behaviour of XLookupString() when XKB is enabled in Xlib
      but not the server.  This fixes an xtest XRebindKeysym() failure
      (David Dawes).

      (#5621, Michel Dänzer).
 895. Fix the return value of SetFontPath() when a font path element is bad
      (David Dawes).

 888. Cure cursor artifacts by setting HARDWARE_CURSOR_SHOW_TRANSPARENT and
      HARDWARE_CURSOR_UPDATE_UNHIDDEN in the r128 and radeon drivers.  The
      wait-for-VSync nonsense the Radeon's currently do can, and should, be
      ripped out later.  (Marc La France).
 887. Extend HARDWARE_CURSOR_SHOW_TRANSPARENT to make hardware cursors
      transparent, rather than disabling them, when a switch to a software
      cursor is needed.  This removes recently introduced cursor artifacts
      in the atimisc driver.  (Marc La France).
 886. Cancel repeat for switch screen XKB actions, which fixes a VT
      switching problem that has just become visible (Ivan Pascal).
 885. Added reinitialization of screen layout after RandR size change
      on a multihead setup. This keeps cursor movement beween screens
      working (Egbert Eich).

      like the slightly different resulting colour definitions from the
      Xcms.txt entries were responsible for an xtest failure.
 883. Fix some problems with using pre-existing version of fontconfig,
      freetype2 and expat (#A.1600, Keith Packard).

      in the names it generates (#5616, Mike Fabian and Juliusz Chroboczek).
 877. Fix a rounding problem in the "freetype" module, which fixes the problem
      worked around in entry 864 below (#5615, Juliusz Chroboczek).
 876. Fix incorrect alias for lv_LV.iso885913, and add some missing lv_LV
      aliases (#5614, Aivils Stoss).
 875. Fix a bug where xauth may write an incomplete authority file and delete
      the old one if there is insufficient disk space (#5612, Harald Hoyer).
 874. DPMSClose() wasn't correctly setting its devPrivate to NULL (based
      on #A.1594, Denis Zaitsev).
 873. Fix scanpci's printing of routing information for PCI-to-PCI bridges
      (Marc La France).

       - Multiwindow Window Manager (Kensuke Matsuzaki).
       - Clipboard integration (Harold Hunt).
       - Remove unnecessary redefines of fchown/fchmod (Takashi Sawanaka)

 871. Fix some problems when noaccel is used in the nsc driver (Sarma Kolluru).
 870. Fix acceleration bugs in the nsc driver (Sarma Kolluru).
 869. Change initMouseHW() to always return TRUE, which restores the older
      more graceful behaviour (Egbert Eich).
 868. Revert the DestroyContext, GarbageCollectDrawables reording in
      dri_util.c, and instead check if the drawable is known to the DRI
      client code before calling XF86DRIGetDrawableInfo (Egbert Eich).
 867. Fix some scaling problems with the updated whiteglass cursor icons,
      fixing some incorrect hotspots (Kevin Puetz).
 866. The sunffb driver was treating a function with a void return value
      as if it had a Bool return value.  This causes the driver to fail
      in some cases (#A.1588, Ferris McCormick).
 865. Add private keysyms for the new XKB actions (XFree86 special keys),
      and move those actions to an XKB compatibility map.  This fixes
      side-effects (loss of auto-repeat and mousekeys functionality) of
      the way this was implemented previously (#5610, Ivan Pascal).
 864. Fix an X server crash with the "freetype" module when displaying

 675. Fix some problems with the addition of multi-layout scheme to
      xkb: some keys that aren't 'alphabetic' should be treated as

         DirectDraw blitter and DirectDraw4 blitter to update damaged
         regions.  The video card's framebuffer is no longer mapped.
       - Works correctly at depths > 8, but colors are not correct at depth 8.
       - Uses the standard Win32 API messages for processing keyboard and
         mouse input rather than using DirectInput.  This is more reliable.
       - Improved internal structure and coding conventions.

         compiled xf_dx.dll is no longer used).
       - The new server can run on machines that don't have DirectDraw/DirectX
         installed (or installed but not operable) by falling back to the
         GDI blitter.  The best drawing interface is determined at startup,
         but this can be overriden with the -engine command line option.
       - The Xrender extension is now supported.
       - Command line option is available to run in full screen mode.

1085. -
1084. Bump the minor revisions of libXmu (UTF8_STRING) and libX11
      (Xutf8LookupString).
1083. Fixes for all known bugs in the CompoundText parser and generator,
      including:
       * While adding a charset:
         - Adding a charset with two different escape sequences (e.g.
           ISO-8859-14) led to broken behaviour of the converter. Moreover
           the second added would have priority over the first added.
         - If an invalid escape sequence was detected by _XlcParseCharSet, it
           was still used when generating compound text.
         - Extended segment charsets with varying number of bytes per character
           were treated like those with 1 byte per character.
         - _XlcAddCT failed to copy its ct_sequence argument, thus leading to
           bugs when this argument was a dynamically allocated string.
         - Missing detection of different charsets having the same escape
           sequence.
       * Parsing Compound Text:
         - The functions _XlcParseCT and _XlcGetCTInfo did not perform range
           checks on the strings being parsed. Danger of core dump through
           out-of-bounds string access if a malicious client provides malformed
           text.
         - Builtin extended segment charsets were not recognized because the
           strncmp in _XlcGetCTInfo was returning false most of the time, due
           to the embedded length bytes.
         - Extended segment charsets in general would not be deactivated after
           the specified number of bytes.
         - In _XlcCheckCTSequence, extended segments with invalid embedded
           length bytes would lead to out-of-bounds string accesses as well.
         - Unrecognized escape sequences did not lead to a return value > 0.
         - Left-to-right and right-to-left indicators (starting with 0x9b) were
           just ignored, without leading to a return value > 0.
         - If the source string was larger than the intermediate buffer,
           multibyte characters could be split into pieces, leading to
           conversion errors.
       * Generating Compound Text:
         - The length embedded in an extended segment prefix was always wrong.
         - Long strings could give rise to extended segments with a length that
           doesn't fit in the allowed 14 bits.
         - After an extended segment, GL or GR designators would unnecessarily
           be repeated.
         - Bytes in the range 0x81..0x88, 0x8b..0x9a, 0x9c..0x9f in multibyte
           encodings could not be output, would be thrown away.
         - Byte 0x9b could not be output in the UTF-8 charset.
       * udcInf.c was generating invalid Compound Text (invalid length in
         extended segment).
       * lcConv.c: If in the indirect converter, the first step led to no
         output, the second step would still be called, possibly leading to
         out-of-bounds accesses.
       * lcUTF8.c: had knowledge about JISX0208.1983-0 but not about
         JISX0208.1990-0.

2210. Fix some compilation problems on Alpha platforms caused by some
      inlines in complier.h being declared as extern instead of static

2191. Fix a cfb24 build problem that shows up with egcs (#2410,
      Alan Hourihane).
2190. Add DPMS, DDC1 and HW cursor support to the SiS driver, and fix panning
      in the SiS driver (#2409, Alan Hourihane).
2189. Put copyright notices from the pandix/panmi code into the merged
      dix/mi versions (#2408, Alan Hourihane).
2188. Update drivers to use the 24/32 conversion layer, and to default to
      a 24bpp framebuffer format when supported.
2187. Make some refinements to the way the depth 24 pixmap format is set.
2186. Replace the ModuleInit function with a ModuleData data object.  This

      in an infinite loop when the "Mode" keyword is used incorrectly in
      a config file.
2162. Add a global default module path to the loader, and a function that
      the common layer can call to set it.

      given depth, and fix a crash in xf86ValidateModes() caused by recent
      changes in this area.
2158. Add an extra argument to LoadSubModule (and LoadModule) to allow the
      caller to optionally specify version and/or ABI requirements that
      the loaded module must meet for the load to complete successfully.
2158. Add support to the loader for vendor-defined ABI classes.  These classes
      are specified as a string.  The main use is for third party modules that
      themselves load sub-modules (like X-TT).
2157. Fix the MGA driver's handling of the "MGA_SDRAM" option.  SDRAM cards
      are still not auto-detected though (#2391, Mark Vojkovich).
2156. Add a screen->screen colour expansion bug workaround to the MGA driver,
      and enable the faster linear expansions instead of the planar ones

      related config file keywords are no longer used.  New flags and options
      have been added to specify the server-wide depth 24 pixmap format.
      A "standard" set of pixmap formats is always advertised, so drivers
      using these don't need to worry about explicitly adding them.
2141. Fix some sun_path overflows in xtrans.
2140. Some panoramix fixups (#2376, Alan Hourihane).
2139. Don't allow arbitrarily long display number strings to be passed on

      Matthieu Herrb).
2115. Import regex for systems that don't have a Posix regex.
2114. Add a LoaderListDir() function that can be used to list the available
      modules.
2113. Modify LoadModule and LoadSubmodule to accept optional subdir and
      pattern lists, and use regular expressions for the module matching
      instead of prefix/suffix lists.
2112. Add a "revpath" utility to xc/config/util to help in dealing with
      imake's use of relative paths.  If this proves to be useful, it could
      be used more widely in imake's rules.
2111. Install some classes of modules into subdirectories of the "modules"
      directory.  The imake module install rules have been updated
      accordingly.
