set message "\n\n\n\
	Enter the horizontal and vertical sync rates of your\n\
	monitor.  These should be listed in your manual.\n\n\
	If you can not find this information, you can pick from the\n\
	the list of common monitor capabilities, the one that best\n\
	describes your monitor, and the appropriate sync rates\n\
	will be filled in for you.\n\n\
	It is very important that these values be correct!\n\n\
	Using video modes that require sync rates beyond the\n\
	capabilities of your monitor may damage it.\n\
	The server will automatically exclude any video modes\n\
	that require sync rates beyond those you enter."
