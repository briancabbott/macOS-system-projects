5. Configuration

   The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
   initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
   section of your XF86Config file are:

       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Intel i740"
	   Driver     "i740"
       EndSection

   or let xf86config or XF86Setup do this for you.

   However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       VideoRam - in kilobytes
       DacSpeed - in MHz
       MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
       IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers


6. Driver Options

   The server automatically detects its configuration, so none of
   these options should be required.

   "NoAccel"  - Turn off hardware acceleration
   "SWCursor" - Request a software cursor (hardware is default)
   "SDRAM"    - Force the use of SDRAM timings
   "SGRAM"    - Force the use of SGRAM timings
   "SlowRam"  - Force the use of slower ram timings
   "Dac6Bit"  - Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default)
   "UsePIO    - Force the use of programmed IO (Memory mapped is the default)

7. Known Limitations

   * Certain drawing operations are very slow when using 24 bit per
     pixel depth mode.
