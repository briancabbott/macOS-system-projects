set message "\n\n\
    XFree86 supports multiple modes that you can cycle\n\
    through while running the X server (on hardware that supports this).\n\
    Click on the modes that you want to have included in your\n\
    configuration.\n\
    \n\
    Additionally, you can select the default color depth the server \n\
    starts in when no overriding flags are given on the command line.\n\
    Be aware that XF86Setup may fail if you select a color depth that\n\
    your hardware (or the server that you have chosen) does not support.\n"
