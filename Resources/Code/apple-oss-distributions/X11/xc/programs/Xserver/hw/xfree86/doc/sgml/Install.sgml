How to install XFree86.

</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
This document contains information about installing the XFree86 binaries
as provided by The XFree86 Project.

<p>
The XFree86 binaries that we provide for UNIX-like OS's (Linux, the
BSDs, Solaris, etc) are packaged in a platform-independent gzipped tar
format (aka "tarballs" identified by the <tt>.tgz</tt> suffix).  Along
with the binaries we provide a customized version of the GNU tar utility
called "extract" and an installation script.  We recommend that these
be used to install the binaries.  (The source for this customized version
of GNU tar can be found in the XFree86 CVS repository's "utils" module,
and from our <url name="ftp site"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/misc/utils-&utilsvers;.tgz">.)

<![ %snapshot [
<p>
Note: for snapshot releases like this one, binaries are only available for
a small number of platforms.

<sect>Downloading the XFree86 &relvers; binaries
<p>

<![ %updaterel [
XFree86 &relvers; is an update release.  The most recent full release
(&fullrelvers;) needs to be installed before installing this update.
Information about downloading and installing &fullrelvers; can be found
in the installation document for that version, which can be found
on the <url name="XFree86 web site"
url="http://www.xfree86.org/&fullrelvers/Install.html">.
]]>

We provide XFree86 &relvers; <![ %updaterel [update ]]>binaries for a range
of operating systems at our
<![ %snapshot; [
<url name="ftp site"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/snapshots/&relvers/binaries/">
]]>
<![ %release; [

and our

<![ %release; [

]]>
Often during releases our site is heavily loaded.  Instead of downloading
directly from us we recommend that instead you use one of our mirror
sites.

<p>
Our binaries are organized by sub-directories which correspond to each
of the OS/platforms for which we provide binaries.  First go to the
sub-directory  that represents your OS platform. In some cases (e.g.,
Linux) there may be a number of choices depending on the architecture
or libc version your platform uses.  In all case we recommend that you
first download the <tt>Xinstall.sh</tt> script, and run it as in the
following example to find out which binary distribution you should
download.

<tscreen><verb>
sh Xinstall.sh -check
</verb></tscreen>

The output of this utility tells you which is the correct set of binaries
for you to download.  If you are careful with this step you will save
yourself a lot time and trouble from NOT downloading an incompatible
distribution.

<bf>NOTES</bf>:

<itemize>
  <item>The Xinstall.sh script must be downloaded in binary mode,
	otherwise it won't run correctly.  If you get lots of "command
	not found" messages when you try to run it, then it is most
	likely because the script wasn't downloaded in binary mode.
	Some web browsers won't do this for files of that name, so we
	also have a copy of it called "<tt>Xinstall.bin</tt>", and most
	browsers should download that correctly.  When downloading it
	under this name, select "save as" on your browser, and save the
	file under the name "<tt>Xinstall.sh</tt>".

  <item>The Xinstall.sh script requires some system commands and
	utilities to function correctly.  While most systems will have
	these, some Linux installations may not.  If you find that the
	script is failing because of some missing system command, you
	will need to install it before you can continue.  If you don't
	know how to do this, then we recommend that you obtain this
	version of XFree86 from your Operating System distributor.

  <item>Always use the version of the Xinstall.sh script that's provided
	with the release you're installing.  Older versions of the script
	may not install newer releases correctly.

  <item>If the binary distribution reported by the Xinstall.sh script
	isn't present on our site, then there are two possibilities.
	The first is that it hasn't been prepared and uploaded yet.
	This is likely if you are looking soon after the release date.
	The second possibility is that we won't have it available at
	all for this release.  This is likely if it's still not there
	about two weeks after the release date.  Check <url name="here"
	url="http://www.xfree86.org/&relvers;/UPDATES.html"> for
	information about updates to our binary distributions, and <url
	name="here" url="http://www.xfree86.org/&relvers;/ERRATA.html">
	for errata related to this release.

</itemize>

Once you're run the <tt>Xinstall.sh</tt> script and found which binary
<![ %updaterel; [update ]]>distribution is suitable for your system,
download the necessary files.  The <![ %fullbinaries [twelve (12)]]><![
%updaterel [four (4)]]> mandatory files for all installations are listed
below.  If you have not downloaded all of the files, the installer script
will complain.

<sect>Installing XFree86 &relvers; using the <tt>Xinstall.sh</tt> script
<p>
We strongly recommend that our XFree86 &relvers; binaries be installed
using the <tt>Xinstall.sh</tt> script that we provide.
<![ %updaterel [It is also important that the previous full release
(&fullrelvers;) is installed before installing this update release.
Make sure that you use the &relvers; version of the <tt>Xinstall.sh</tt>
script to install this update.  Older versions may not be able to do it
correctly.]]>
There are a lot of
steps in the manual installation process, and those steps can vary
according to the platform and hardware setup.  <![ %fullbinaries [There is a description of
the manual installation process for the most common cases <ref
id="manual-install" name="below">.]]>

You must login as the super user (root) to run the installer script.
Place all of the downloaded files into a single directory (choose a
temporary location with enough space).  Use the cd command to change to
that directory and then run the installer script as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
sh Xinstall.sh
</verb></tscreen>

Answer the prompts as they come up.  If you are missing something that
is required, the installer may tell you to install it before trying
again.  If the problem is that you did not download all of mandatory
files aforementioned, then the installer will tell you which ones are
missing and ask you to download them before proceeding.

<sect1>Questions the installer may ask
<p>
The installer asks some questions that may not have obvious answers.  The
information here should help you answer them.  In most cases, apart from
the first question, the default answers should be OK.

If you run the installer from within an X session (the installer checks
if <tt>$DISPLAY</tt> is set), you will be warned that doing so is not
a good idea.  Unless you have a good reason for knowing that this won't
be a problem, you should exit your X session, including stopping xdm or
equivalent if it is running, before continuing.  If you ignore this
warning and run into problems, well, you were warned!

<![ %fullbinaries [If you have an existing X installation, you]]>
<![ %updaterel [You ]]>
will be warned that proceeding
with this installation will overwrite it.  Only those things that are
part of our standard distribution will be overwritten.  Other X
applications that you may have installed will not be removed.  Some
configuration files may be overwritten though, but the installer should
prompt you before doing so.  As the opening greeting says, it is
<bf>strongly</bf> recommended that you backup any existing installation
before proceeding.  If you want your old applications to still be there
after you've installed, don't do the "backup" by simply renaming
your old <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> directory.  It is better to make a copy of
it, and then install over the top of the original one.  If you run into
problems and want to revert to the old installation, you can then
delete the overwritten one and copy the saved version back.

During the first part of the installation over an existing version, the
script may remove some old files or directories that would get in the
way of the new installation.  It will list which files/directories have
been removed.  If none are listed, then none were removed.

<![ %fullbinaries [
The next step when installing over an existing version is to check for
existing configuration files.  As of XFree86 version 3.9.18, the run-time
configuration files are installed by default under <tt>/etc/X11</tt>
instead of under <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt>.  The installer will move
the existing ones for you and create the necessary symbolic links.  If
you don't want to have these configuration files under <tt>/etc/X11</tt>,
then you should answer "no" when asked about it.  Answering "no" here
also means that the new configuration files will be installed in the
old <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt> location.

Note: for the rare systems that don't have symbolic links, this question
will not be asked.  The default answer is "yes" because that is best
for most situations.  It is our new default.  It makes it easier to
share the <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> directory between multiple hosts, and
allows it to be mounted read-only.  If you don't need these features,
then you can safely answer "no" if you don't want them moved.

When installing over an existing version, you will be prompted before
each set of configuration files is installed.  If you haven't made any
Customisations to your existing configuration files, then you can safely
answer "yes" for each of these.  If you have made customisations, you
can try answering "no".  If you run into problems later, you may need
to manually merge your customisations into the the new version of the
configuration files.  The configuration files can all be found in the
<tt>Xetc.tgz</tt> tarball.  See the <ref id="manual-install" name="section
below"> about manual installation for information about extracting them
separately.

After the configuration files have been dealt with, the other mandatory
components of the binary distribution will be installed.  This should
proceed without any user intervention.

If you downloaded any of the optional components, the installer will
ask you about each one before it is installed.  The default answer is
"yes".  If there are any that you've since decided that you don't want
to install, answer "no" when prompted.

After that is done, the main part of the installation is complete.  The
next steps are to tidy up some aspects of the installation.  The first
of these is to run "<tt>ldconfig</tt>" on systems that require it, so
that the newly installed shared libraries are accessible.  Then
the <tt>fonts.dir</tt> files in some directories are updated so that
the fonts can be accessed correctly.  Next, the installer checks to
see if your system has a termcap file or terminfo files.  If it finds
the former, it tells you how you may update the entries in that file.
If it finds the latter, it asks you if you want it to update them
for you.

You may be asked if you want to create links for the GL libraries and
header files.  The OpenGL standard on some platforms (Linux in particular)
says that these should be installed in the standard system locations
(<tt>/usr/lib</tt> and <tt>/usr/include</tt>), so the installer offers
to create the appropriate links.  If you're running Linux, you should
probably answer yes.  For other platforms it is your choice.  If you
already have another version of libGL in /usr/lib, answering "yes" will
remove it and replace it with a link to the version we supply.  The
installer will show you a listing of any existing versions before asking
if they should be replaced.

Finally, the installer asks you if you want a link created for the
<tt>rstart</tt> utility.  On most modern systems the link isn't essential,
so the default answer is "no".  Answer "yes" if you know that you need
it.  If you find later that you need it, you can create it easily by
running:

<tscreen><verb>
rm -f /usr/bin/rstartd
ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/rstartd /usr/bin/rstartd
</verb></tscreen>

]]>

<sect1>After the installation is complete
<p>
The next step is to configure the X server.  That is covered in detail
in an as-yet unwritten document :-(.  In the meantime, there are three
ways to create a basic X server configuration file for XFree86 &relvers;.
One is to run the <tt>xf86config</tt> utility.  Another is to run the
<tt>xf86cfg</tt> utility.  The third option is to use the new
<tt>-configure</tt> X server option:

<tscreen><verb>
XFree86 -configure
</verb></tscreen>

Note that if you are running Darwin/Mac OS X, there is no step 3 :-).
You should skip this step, as configuration is not required or possible.
The X server configuration file is not used on Darwin/Mac OS X.

The X server config file (<tt>XF86Config</tt>) format has changed
compared to 3.3.x.  Also, its default location is now <tt>/etc/X11</tt>.
Finally, there is now only one X server for driving video hardware,
and it is called "<tt>XFree86</tt>".  Once you're satisfied with the
operation of the new X server, you can safely remove the old
<tt>XF86_*</tt> and/or <tt>XF98_*</tt> X server binaries from
<tt>/usr/X11R6/bin</tt>.

After the X server configuration is done, it may be advisable to reboot,
especially if you run xdm (or equivalent) or the font server (xfs).

<![ %fullbinaries [
<sect>Installing XFree86 &relvers; manually<label id="manual-install">
<p>
This section contains information about manually installing the XFree86
&relvers; binary distributions.  You should only use this method if you
know what you're doing.  The information here covers some common cases,
but not every possible case.  It also may not be complete or up to date.
Use at your own risk.

Put all of the downloaded files into a single directory (choose some
temporary location with enough space).  Become the super user (root).
All of the following commands should be run as root, and they should be
run from the directory that has all of the downloaded files.  The
"<tt>extract</tt>" utility should be used to unpack the tarballs.  This
is a customised version of GNU tar that has the gzip code built-in, and
which has a different usage when run under the name "extract".  One
important thing that <tt>extract</tt> does that most versions of tar do
not do by default is that it unlinks existing files before writing new
ones.  This is important when installing over an existing version of X.
If you choose to use some other utility to extract the tarballs, you're
on your own.

<sect1>A new installation
<p>
The simplest case is when there is no existing X installation.  The
installation procedure for this case is as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
chmod +x extract
mkdir /usr/X11R6
mkdir /etc/X11
./extract -C /usr/X11R6 X[a-df-uw-z]*.tgz
./extract -C /usr/X11R6 Xvfb.tgz    # If you are installing Xvfb
./extract -C /etc/X11 Xetc.tgz
./extract -C /var Xvar.tgz
ln -s /etc/X11/app-defaults /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/fs /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/lbxproxy /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/proxymngr /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/rstart /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/twm /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/xdm /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/xinit /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/xsm /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
ln -s /etc/X11/xserver /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
chmod ug-w /usr/X11R6/lib           # Make sure the permissions are OK
/sbin/ldconfig /usr/X11R6/lib       # For Linux
/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/X11R6/lib    # For FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
/usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Installing over an old installation
<p>
If you have an existing installation of X, you should make a backup copy
of it before installing the new version over the top of it.

Before doing anything else, make sure the <tt>extract</tt> command is
executable, and also link it to the name "<tt>gnu-tar</tt>" so that it
can be used as a regular <tt>tar</tt> command:

<tscreen><verb>
chmod +x extract
rm -f gnu-tar
ln extract gnu-tar
</verb></tscreen>

The first part of the procedure is to move the old run-time config files
from <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt> to <tt>/etc/X11</tt>.  Create
<tt>/etc/X11</tt> if it doesn't already exist.  For each of the following
sub-directories (<tt>app-defaults</tt>, <tt>fs</tt>, <tt>lbxproxy</tt>,
<tt>proxymngr</tt>, <tt>rstart</tt>, <tt>twm</tt>, <tt>xdm</tt>,
<tt>xinit</tt>, <tt>xsm</tt>, <tt>xserver</tt>) that you want to move,
check that there is a sub-directory of this name in
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt>.  Create a sub-directory of the same name
under <tt>/etc/X11</tt>, then copy the files over by running:

<tscreen><verb>
./gnu-tar -C /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/subdir -c -f - . | \
  ./gnu-tar -C /etc/X11/subdir -v -x -p -U -f -
</verb></tscreen>

For each subdirectory that is moved, remove the one under
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt> and create a symbolic link to the new
location:

<tscreen><verb>
rm -fr /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/subdir
ln -s /etc/X11/subdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
</verb></tscreen>

For those subdirectories that didn't already exist under
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</tt>, create one under <tt>/etc/X11</tt> and
create the symbolic link to it:

<tscreen><verb>
mkdir /etc/X11/subdir
ln -s /etc/X11/subdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
</verb></tscreen>

Once that is done, extract the config files from the <tt>Xetc.tgz</tt>
tarball into a temporary directory:

<tscreen><verb>
mkdir tmpdir
./extract -C tmpdir Xetc.tgz
</verb></tscreen>

and then copy each sub-directory over to the installed location:

<tscreen><verb>
./gnu-tar -C tmpdir/subdir -c -f - . | \
  ./gnu-tar -C /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/subdir -v -x -p -U -f -
</verb></tscreen>

If you have customised any config files in your old installation, you
may want to omit those sub-directories, or copy selected files over by
hand.

Once that's done, the main part of the installation can be done:

<tscreen><verb>
./extract -C /usr/X11R6 `pwd`/X[a-df-uw-z]*.tgz
./extract -C /usr/X11R6 Xvfb.tgz    # If you are installing Xvfb
./extract -C /var Xvar.tgz
chmod ug-w /usr/X11R6/lib           # Make sure the permissions are OK
/sbin/ldconfig /usr/X11R6/lib       # For Linux
/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/X11R6/lib    # For FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
/usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
</verb></tscreen>
