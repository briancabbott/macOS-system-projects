This document provides information about the status of the driver and
hardware support in XFree86 &relvers; compared with that in XFree86
&legacyvers;.  Please send updates for this document to
<email>XFree86@XFree86.org</email>.

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
This document contains one section per vendor (organised alphabetically)
for each chipset family that is supported in XFree86 &legacyvers; or
XFree86 &relvers;.  It includes information about the status of the
drivers and the hardware they support, including a comparison of the
level of support between versions &legacyvers; and &relvers;.  Unless
otherwise stated, hardware is classified as "supported" if its driver
provides basic 2D support.  Support for additional features may or may
not be present.

In XFree86 &legacyvers;, several X servers are available; much hardware
uses the XF86_SVGA server, which has a set of driver modules that are built
into it at compile time.  In other cases, X servers for specific chips (or
families of chips) are provided (such as XF86_AGX, XF86_Mach64, etc.).

In XFree86 &relvers;, there is only one X server, called "XFree86", which
can load driver modules at runtime.  Thus there is no specific mention of a
server binary when &relvers; is discussed; only the XFree86 server is
used.  Third-party vendors (often the manufacturers of various video
chipsets) may provide their own drivers for the XFree86 server, but these
third-party modules are beyond the scope of this document.

NOTE: Status information needs to be checked carefully and expanded where
possible.  E.g., include information about acceleration, multi-head, known
problems, hardware known to work on, platform dependencies/limitations,
other architectures known to work on (e.g., Alpha, PPC), etc.
