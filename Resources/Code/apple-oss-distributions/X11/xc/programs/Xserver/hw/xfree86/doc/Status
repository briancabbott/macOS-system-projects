                                  Abstract

     This document provides information about the status of the driver
     and hardware support in XFree86 4.3.0 compared with that in XFree86
     3.3.6.  Please send updates for this document to
     <XFree86@XFree86.org>.

1.  Introduction

This document contains one section per vendor (organised alphabetically) for
each chipset family that is supported in XFree86 3.3.6 or XFree86 4.3.0.  It
includes information about the status of the drivers and the hardware they
support, including a comparison of the level of support between versions
3.3.6 and 4.3.0.  Unless otherwise stated, hardware is classified as "sup-
ported" if its driver provides basic 2D support.  Support for additional fea-
tures may or may not be present.

In XFree86 3.3.6, several X servers are available; much hardware uses the
XF86_SVGA server, which has a set of driver modules that are built into it at
compile time.  In other cases, X servers for specific chips (or families of
chips) are provided (such as XF86_AGX, XF86_Mach64, etc.).

In XFree86 4.3.0, there is only one X server, called "XFree86", which can
load driver modules at runtime.  Thus there is no specific mention of a
server binary when 4.3.0 is discussed; only the XFree86 server is used.
Third-party vendors (often the manufacturers of various video chipsets) may
provide their own drivers for the XFree86 server, but these third-party mod-
ules are beyond the scope of this document.

NOTE: Status information needs to be checked carefully and expanded where
possible.  E.g., include information about acceleration, multi-head, known
problems, hardware known to work on, platform dependencies/limitations, other
architectures known to work on (e.g., Alpha, PPC), etc.

2.  3Dfx

      3.3.6:
            Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo3
            cards is provided by the XF86_SVGA server with the tdfx driver.

      4.3.0:
            Support for Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 chips is provided by the
            "glide" driver (this requires version 2.x of the Glide library,
            which is not part of the XFree86 distribution).

            Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee, Voodoo3,
            Voodoo4, and Voodoo5 is provided by the "tdfx" driver.

      Summary:
            All hardware supported in 3.3.6 is also supported in 4.3.0.  The
            Voodoo Graphics, Voodoo2, Voodoo4, and Voodoo5 are supported only
            in 4.3.0.

3.  3Dlabs

            Support (including acceleration) for the Permedia series (includ-
            ing 1, 2, 2a, 2v, 3, and 4) and GLINT series (including 300SX,
            500TX, MX, R3 and R4) with the Gamma, Gamma2 or Delta coprocessor
            is provided by the "glint" driver.

      Summary:
            All hardware supported in 3.3.6 is also supported in 4.3.0.  The
            Permedia 3, Permedia 4, GLINT R3, GLINT R4 and Gamma2 are sup-
            ported only in 4.3.0.

4.  Alliance

            incomplete support for the AP6422.

      Summary:
            The AP6422 is supported in 3.3.6 but not fully in 4.3.0.  All
            other hardware supported in 3.3.6 is also supported in 4.3.0.

            GZ), Rage LT Pro (LD, LB, LI, LP), Rage LT, Rage XL or XC (GL,
            GM, GN, GO, GR, GS) and Rage Mobility (LM, LN, LR, LS) (by the
            XF86_Mach64 server).  Unaccelerated support is provided for most
            of the above (except some early Mach8 and Mach32 adapters), as
            well the old VGAWonder series chipsets (18800, 18800-1, 28800-2,
            28800-4, 28800-5, 28800-6) by the XF86_SVGA server with the ati
            driver.  Accelerated support is provided for the Rage 128 chips

            using the al2101 driver for the AL2101, and the ali driver for
            the others.  These drivers reportedly work, but they have no
            maintainer.

      4.3.0:
            No Avance Logic chips are supported because the old drivers have
            not been ported.

10.  Compaq/Digital

      3.3.6:
            The old Compaq AVGA chipset is supported by the XF86_SVGA server
            with the compaq driver.  The status of this support is unknown
            because we don't have any recent test reports, and this driver
            has no maintainer.

            Support (accelerated) for the DEC 21030 TGA 8 plane, 24 plane and
            24 plane 3D chips (on Alpha platforms) is provided by the
            XF86_TGA server.

      4.3.0:
            No support exists for the Compaq AVGA (its driver hasn't been
            ported).

            Support (accelerated) for the DEC 21030 TGA 8 plane, 24 plane and
            24 plane 3D chips (only tested on Alpha platforms) is provided by
            the "tga" driver.

      Summary:
            No Compaq AVGA chips are supported in 4.3.0.  DEC TGA support is
            equivalent in both 3.3.6 and 4.3.0.

            XF86_SVGA server with the spc8100 driver.

      4.3.0:
            No Epson chips are supported, because the old driver has not been
            ported.

      Summary:
            No Epson chips are supported in 4.3.0.

13.  Genoa

      3.3.6:
            The old Genoa GVGA chipset is supported by the XF86_SVGA server
            with the gvga driver.  The status of this support is unknown
            because we don't have any recent test reports, and this driver
            has no maintainer.

      4.3.0:
            No Genoa chips are supported, because the old driver has not been
            ported.

      Summary:

            Support for the standard IBM VGA chip (and compatibles) is pro-
            vided by the "vga" driver.

            There is no support for the IBM 8514/A or XGA-2 because the
            drivers have not been ported.

      Summary:

            XF86_SVGA server with the i740 driver, and for the Intel i810
            with the i810 driver.  The i810 is supported only on Linux, and
            requires the agpgart.o kernel module in order to use modes that
            require more than 1MB of video memory.

      4.3.0:
            Support (accelerated) for the Intel i740 is provided by the
            "i740" driver, and support for the Intel integrated graphics
            chipsets i810, i810-dc100, i810e, i815, 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM
            and 865G is provided by the "i810" driver.  The i810 and i815
            chipsets require kernel-level AGP GART support (available on
            Linux, FreeBSD, and some other BSDs).  The 830M and later can be
            used without AGP GART support, but it is required for full func-
            tionality.

      Summary:
            The i740 and and original i810 are supported in both versions,
            but the i810/i815 is supported only on Linux, FreeBSD, and some
            recent NetBSD/OpenBSD versions at present.  platforms at present.
            Support for later versions of the i810 chipset, such as the i815,
            and for the 830M and later exists only in 4.3.0.
