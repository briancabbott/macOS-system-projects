	+ Xrender and Xft had several bugs related to
	  rendering manually placed or poly-face text

	+ Added more complete memory tracing in fontconfig
	  Checked with (patched) mozilla and found no leaks

	+ Updated Latin orthographies by comparing those from
	  evertype.com with those from eki.ee.  Tried to make
	  sensible choices, including chars that occured in both
	  and leaving some optional chars out that occured only
	  in one.

	+ Owen discovered that FcLangSetHasLang wasn't actually
	  checking the language set.

	+ Append a version number to cache filenames

Thu Aug 22 11:36:18 PDT 2002	keithp

	+ Add "contains" and "not_contains" operators and elements to
	  font configuration
	  
	+ Changed semantics of eq operator for LangSets to check for
	  FcLangEqual so that any match will do
	
	+ FcFontList was using FcConfigCompareValue (...FcOpEqual) instead
	  of FcValueEqual to check for identical values when inserting into
	  the results.  This broke when the above semantic change was made,
	  now it uses FcValueEqual which is "more correct" in any case.

	+ Reimplement FC_LANG as new datatype.  Lists of strings
	  was consuming over a megabyte of memory for 401 fonts.

	+ Freeze patterns loaded from cache files.  This shares
	  common value lists and common patterns which saves
	  considerable memory.

	+ Change the denotation of 'constant' charsets to use special
	  ref value instead of separate boolean.

	+ Clean up leak tracing stuff, found several unannoted alloc/free
	  calls

	+ Fix memory leak when parsing matrices from XML

Mon Aug 19 11:57:27 PDT 2002	keithp

	+ Fix autoconf files to pass FONTCONFIG_PATH on
	  compile line so that ${prefix} gets substituted
	  correctly.

	+ Use getc_unlocked/putc_unlocked on systems that
	  provide them to avoid damage done to stdio by posix

	+ Eliminate FC_PATTERN and FcTypePattern in favor of
	  an extended api for FcConfigSubstitute which takes
	  both the font and the pattern.

	+ Add 'sans serif' alias for 'sans-serif' as some apps
	  can't handle hyphens in family names

	+ Eliminate pretense of support for libxml2

	+ Comment origins of Han orthographies

Tue Jul 30 18:37:09 PDT 2002	keithp

	+ Add binding property to edit element so that strong
	  binding values may be inserted by the config file.
	  The default remains weak.

Sun 28 Jul 04:16:55 PDT 2002	keithp

	+ Tagged release candidate 1 in the CVS tree and
	  placed fcpackage.rc1.tar.gz for distribution

Thu Aug  1 08:55:08 PDT 2002	keithp

	+ Fixed autoconf builds to always specify install
	  target files (for BSD).  Also fixed to
	  define FONTCONFIG_PATH in config.h so that
	  nonstandard installs will actually work.
