To compile this X distribution you need the X11LibApple binary package
installed on the root volume. This can be found in the subdirectory on
one of the Mac OS X installation CDs. Note that for X11 1.0 the
X11LibApple package from Mac OS X 10.3 is required.

(To check if this package is already installed, look for files
/usr/include/Xplugin.h and /usr/lib/libXplugin*.dylib)

After installing the X11LibApple package, cd into the "xc" directory
and type:

	$ make World			# build everything
	$ sudo make install		# install everything but manpages
	$ sudo make install.man		# install manpages
