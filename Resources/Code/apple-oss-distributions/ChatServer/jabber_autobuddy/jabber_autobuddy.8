.Nm jabber_autobuddy
.Ar [options] <command> [command arguments]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
jabber_autobuddy is a utility for managing buddies/contacts for jabberd by directly modifying the service's SQLite database tables.  The primary use of the tool is to make all jabber users a "buddy" of every other jabber user, which is not ideal for a system with a large number of users.  See the list of commands for a description of each supported operation.  The JID specified in the commands is of format <username>@<hostname>.  Logging goes to syslog.

.Sh Notes
.Pp
[1] JID is a Jabber ID in the form <username>@<hostname>, where:
      username   is the short name (record name) from any Open Directory
                 account in the server's directory search path.
      hostname   is be a domain (or realm) that the local jabberd service 
                 is configured to host.
.Pp
[2] Commands which modify the jabberd database may be used multiple times
    in the same execution and in any order.  However, when used this way,
    the commands are evaluated in the following order:
      * all --deleteuser commands
      * all --inituser commands
      * all --removebuddy commands
      * all --addbuddy commands
      * the --all, --group or --ungroup command
.Pp
[3] The --inituser and --deleteuser commands only modify the local
    jabberd database for the selected users.  These command do not affect
    user account data stored in the directory.
.Pp
[4] The --all, --group and --ungroup commands may not be used in the same
    execution.
.Pp
[5] Multiple uses of the --verbose option are treated as a single use of
    that option.
.Pp
[6] Multiple uses of the --all, --group or --ungroup commands are treated
    as a single use of each command.
.Pp
[7] Use of the --help or --version commands in combination with other
    commands will only display the help or version text.  All other
    commands will be ignored for that execution.
.Pp
[8] The --inituser command is a prerequisite for the  --deleteuser,
    --addbuddy and --removebuddy commands.
.Pp
[9] The format for domains is the same as for host names 
    (ex: example.com, chat.example.com, etc).
