In this directory, you will find 3 MailDemo examples.

- MailDemoSimple: The simple version that you can download at the very 
  beginning of the tutorial, translated to RubyCocoa.

- MailDemoBindings: The simple version modified to actually use Cocoa bindings.

- MailDemoActiveRecordBindings: A specialized version that uses the 
  'osx/active_record' library to achieve persistent storage by using 
  ActiveRecord with a sqlite3 backend. It shows how to use a belongs_to 
  relationship with a subclass of NSArrayController.
