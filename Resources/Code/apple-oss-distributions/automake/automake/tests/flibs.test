# This test currently fails with automake v. 1.3 since automake assumes
# that elements of `bin_PROGRAMS' (e.g. zardoz) without a corresponding
# `_SOURCES' (e.g. zardoz_SOURCES) should be compiled from `zardoz.c'
# whether or not `zardoz.c' actually exists.  For example, even if the
# file `zardoz.c' doesn't exist but the file `zardoz.f' does exist, this
# tests would still fail.
#
# Therefore, for now I have put in the line `zardoz_SOURCES = zardoz.f'
# (see below) so that automake's top-level `make check' won't fail, but
# this line should be removed once automake handles this situation
# correctly.
