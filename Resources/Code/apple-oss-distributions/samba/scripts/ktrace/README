These files are useful for updating the tracepoints for kdebug tracing.

ktrace.names: This is the full (ordered) list of trace points generated from
smbprofile.h, you can regenerate this by filtering out the list of PR_VALUE_*
constants and doing a quick name transform.

smb-kdebug.pl: This takes ktrace.names as input an generates a mapping from
trace point codes to (arguably) human-readable names. This mapping can be
appended to trace.codes.
