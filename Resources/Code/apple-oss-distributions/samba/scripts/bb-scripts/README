This directory contains scripts for automating Samba testing via
BigBrother. 

The only scripts that should live on BigBrother are FetchCurrentSamba
and SambaServerTest -

    o FetchCurrentSamba is needed to pull the samba source tree
    that corresponds to the build that is being tested.

    o SambaServerTest is a very simple script that installs the test
    requirements and traps into CurrentSambaServerTest which is the real
    implementation of the test suite.

Please copy these scripts to coreos-bb when you update them.
