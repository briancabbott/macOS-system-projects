<H2>What is an assertion?</H2>

<P>An assertion, or a signal, is code that verifies whether a
condition that should always be true is satisfied, and interrupts the
flow of the program if the condition fails. Assertions are a very
useful debugging tool, because they reveal situations in which the
program is not in a state it should be, thus exposing bugs that might
be hard to find otherwise.</P>

<P>Assertions ae different from exceptions (which are, confusingly,
also called signals in some texts; then there are UNIX signals
too...), because assertions are a debugging aid, and exceptions are
an error-handling mechanism.</P>

<P>A typical assertion would look like this: suppose that
DeleteObject is a function that takes a non-nil pointer to an Object,
and deletes it. Obviously, nil is not a valid input for that
function, so we could write:</P>

<PRE><CODE>void
DeleteObject (
	Object*	inObject)
{
	Assert_ (inObject != nil);
	/* delete the object */
&nbsp;
}</CODE></PRE>

<P>Of course, were DeleteObject designed to take nil pointers, this
assertion would be unnecessary.</P>

<P>Common behavior of assertions is to display an error message,
usually including some amount of debugging information. Since
assertions can be computationally expensive, it is common to remove
some assertions from final versions of programs, but leave them in
debugging versions.</P>

<P>For additional general information about assertions (and other
debugging techniques) you should refer to a good book, such as Steve
Maguire's "Writing Solid Code". This section is by no means
sufficient to describe all the good and useful things about
assertions.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<H2>When should I use an assertion?</H2>

<P>Whenever you can and it makes sense to do so.</P>

<P>If your code makes an assumption about its parameters, assert it.
This is especially important for library developers, since they have
no control over the parameters passed into the library, but they
frequently need to make an assumption about the parameters passed, or
place a restriction on the valid values of parameters. The above
example is a good example of this technique.</P>

<P>If you write a piece of code that performs some algorithm which
has some preconditions (conditions that are necessary for the
algorithm to be valid) and postconditions (conditions that are
guaranteed to be true if the algorithm is correct), assert them. For
example, let MatrixAdd be a function that takes two matrices of the
same size and returns their sum:</P>

<PRE>Matrix
MatrixAdd (
	Matrix	inMatrix1,
	Matrix	inMatrix2)
{
	Assert_ (	(NumberOfRows (inMatrix1) == NumberOfRows (inMatrix2)) &amp;&amp;
			(NumberOfColumns (inMatrix1) == NumberOfColumns (inMatrix2));
	/* add the matrices */
}</PRE>

<P>Do <B>not</B> use assertions for error handling. If a combination
of input parameters to your function is valid, but generates an
error, don't assert; return an error code instead.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<H2>How should I prepare my project for assertions?</H2>

<P>First, make sure you've prepared your targets and prefix files as
described in <A HREF="index.html">How do I use DebuggingLib?</A></P>

<P>Then, add the following to your project prefix file:</P>

<PRE><CODE>#include &lt;Debug.h&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>Debug.h and some other header files require specific #include
order to work; in particular, ansi_prefix.mac.h (if you are using it)
must come before Debug.h in your prefix file.</P>

<P>If you are using PowerPlant, you can add Debug.h to your
precompiler headers, but it has to come <B>after</B> UDebugging.h.
</P>

<P>In your source files, you'll need:</P>

<PRE><CODE>#include &lt;Debug.Assert.h&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>You also need to add DebuggingLib.[68K|PPC][.debug] to your project.</P>

<P>If you are building a PowerPlant application, you should replace
UDebugging.cp with DebuggingLib.[68K|PPC][.debug]. PowerPlant code
will then automatically use the Debugging library (including getting
the "Debug" button in assertion alerts), and you can use assertions
in your code as described in the rest of this document.</P>

<P>Note: only versions 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 of PowerPlant are supported
right now (these are versions of PowerPlant in CW Pro 4).</P>

<HR>
<H2>How should I use assertions?</H2>

<P>Glad you asked. For your basic assertion needs, use one of the
following:</P>

<PRE>SignalIf_ (aCondition);
SignalIfNot_ (aCondition);<CODE>
Assert_ (aCondition);</CODE>
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The meaning is self-explanatory: SignalIf_ will alert you to an
unexpected condition if aCondition is true; SignalIfNot_ and Assert_
will alert you if aCondition is false.</P>

<P>The default behavior of assertions is to display an alert, both in
debug and in final version. The alert is slightly different between
two versions: in the debug version it has a button which lets you
debug the application by dropping into Metrowerks debugger or
MacsBug, and the alert in the final version has more user-friendly
text.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Advanced Topics</H2>

<P>There are several ways you can do more interesting things with
assertions. In most cases, you won't have to use them, so this
section is entirely optional.</P>

<H3>Asserting with customized strings</H3>

<P>In some cases you might want to assert with a specific message,
which may not correspond to some useful boolean condition. You can do
that using:</P>

<PRE><CODE>SignalPStr_ (inPascalString);
SignalCStr_ (inCString);</CODE></PRE>

<P>These two alert you immediately, but the message displayed in the
alert/debugger message contains the specified string, instead of a
quoted boolean condition.</P>

<P>The argument to <CODE>SignalPStr_</CODE> can be either a string
literal (text between quotes) or a pascal string variable. The
argument to <CODE>SignalCStr_</CODE> must be string literal, and
cannot be a <CODE>char*</CODE> (this is because the macro uses
preprocessor concatenation to convert the string to a Pascal string).
For example:</P>

<PRE><CODE>if (lateInTheEvening) {
	Sleep ();
} else 
	SignalPStr_ ("\pIt's too early to sleep. Tool some more.");</CODE></PRE>

<H3>Changing runtime assertion behavior</H3>

<P>If you need to specify the behavior an assertion will have, you
can use the following two:</P>

<PRE><CODE>SetSignalAction_ (inSignalAction);
RestoreSignalAction_ ();</CODE></PRE>

<P>Because of the way these are defined, you must put the call to
<CODE>SetSignalAction_</CODE> within, or immediatelly before or
after, the declarations section of the block for which you want to
have an alternate behavior:</P>

<PRE><CODE>{
	SetSignalAction_ (signalAction_SourceDebugger);
	long	i;
	long j = 0;
	
	/* Do something */
	
	RestoreSignalAction_ ();
}</CODE>
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>You absolutely <B>must</B> (and I mean it) restore the changes you
made, except when you are writing an application and the call to
<CODE>SetSignalAction_ </CODE>is at the beginning of your main().
</P>

<P>The valid values of <CODE>inSignalAction</CODE>, and their
meanings, are:<TABLE BORDER=1>

</TABLE></P>

<H3>When should I change the assertion behavior?</H3>

<P>Almost never. There are two important situations when you might
want to:</P>

<H4>Altering the behavior while debugging</H4>

<P>If you find yourself debugging some code, and you want to change
the assertion behavior from that point on, you must change the value
of the global variable <CODE>gSignalAction</CODE>. (Of course, all
standard warnings about changing variables in your program apply.)
The debugging library uses this value to determine the runtime
behavior of assertions, and you can use the debugger to set the value
of this variable to any of the values given in the table above. This
is, in fact, what the <CODE>SetSignalAction_</CODE> macro does, but
you shouldn't rely on that in your code.</P>

<H4>Altering the behavior programatically</H4>

<P>There may be some cases when you cannot allow arbitrary behavior
inside a code segment (for example, you should not allow alerts from
an interrupt handler or CFM initialization function). This is not an
issue in most cases, but for the rare cases when this must be done,
you can use the macros described above.</P>

<H3>Changing assertion compiler options</H3>

<P>Since assertions can be computationally expensive, it is
frequently desirable to strip some of them from final versions. On
the other hand, it's better for an application to display a nice
alert than to lock up or otherwise irritate users. Hence, assertions
have three levels of compile-time support:</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P><CODE>SignalMode_All_</CODE>
      </TD><TD>
         <P>All assertions/signals are compiled into the code.
         Runtime behavior corresponds to the debug column of the
         previous table.
      </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P><CODE>SignalMode_Inexpensive_</CODE>
      </TD><TD>
         <P>Only assertions/signals not marked as computationally
         expensive are compiled into code. Runtime behavior
         corresponds to the final column of the previous table.
      </TD></TR>
   <TR>
      <TD>
         <P><CODE>SignalMode_None_</CODE>
      </TD><TD>
         <P>No assertions/signals are compiled into code.
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>You can change this option by using one of:</P>

<PRE><CODE>#define SignalMode_ SignalMode_All_
#define SignalMode_ SignalMode_Inexpensive_
#define SignalMode_ SignalMode_None_</CODE></PRE>

<P>From that point on, your asserts will be compiled according to the
option you specify.</P>

<H4>Shielding computationally expensive assertions</H4>

<P>Given the above, you are probably wondering how you should mark
your expensive assertions, so that they can be removed from your
final version. You can use</P>

<PRE><CODE>#if SignalMode_ == SignalMode_All_
#endif /* SignalMode_ */</CODE></PRE>

<P>to achieve that. For example:</P>

<PRE><CODE>#if SignalMode_ == SignalMode_All_
	Assert_ (CalculateSomethingHorriblyComplicated () == noErr);
#endif /* SignalMode_ */</CODE></PRE>

<P>This assertion will be removed from your final version, and so
your final version won't carry the computational overhead.</P>

<H4>Asserting complex expressions</H4>

<P>In some cases, you might need to assert based on the result of
some complex expression; in fact, the expression might be so complex
that you can't write it in a single conditional. In this case, you
should bracket that part of your code inside</P>

<PRE><CODE>#if SignalMode_ == SignalMode_All_
#endif /* SignalMode_ */</CODE></PRE>

<P>or</P>

<PRE><CODE>#if SignalMode_ != SignalMode_None_
#endif /* SignalMode_ */</CODE></PRE>

<P>depending on whether you want the statements that comprise the
assertion to be in the final version or not.</P>

<P>I also recommend you put those blocks of code inside {} braces;
that way you will reduce the chance of accidentally introducing
dependencies between your debug and final code (see more about this
in Caveats). For example:</P>

<PRE><CODE>#if SignalMode_ == SignalMode_All_
/* The sum must be non-zero */
{
	int i;
	int theSumOfEyes = 0;
	for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
		theSumOfEyes += DoSomething (i);
	}
	Assert_ (theSumOfEyes != 0);
}
#endif /* SignalMode_ */</CODE>
&nbsp;
</PRE>		

<HR>
<H2>Caveats</H2>

<P>Assertions can be tricky. Assertions are based on preprocessor
macros. This implementation of assertions also uses a global
variable. Therefore, there are some things you can do to shoot
yourself in the foot. Assuming you are not very keen to do that
(maybe because someday you'll miss and shoot everybody else, at which
point we'll hunt you down and make you understand the layout of the
macathena locker), here are some ways to avoid when using assertions:
</P>

<H3>Don't assert on expressions with side effects</H3>

<P>This is a bad way to assert:</P>

<PRE><CODE>Assert_ ((myHandle = NewHandle (inSize)) == nil);</CODE></PRE>

<P>When this code is compiled with assertions turned off,
<CODE>myHandle</CODE> will never be allocated. Boom.</P>

<H3>Don't add functionality to your code with assertions</H3>

<P>The assertions in your code should almost always rely on normal
flow of your code, by checking the values your code normally
produces, or paths your code normally takes. In rare cases, you might
want to use an alternate algorithm to double-check the result your
code normally produces. In no case should your assertions (and
debugging code in general) perform anything that your final code
doesn't. (This is really just a generalization of the first caveat.)
Consequences of failing to follow this rule can range from minor
annoyance to horrible mess, if, for example, you don't test your
final version well enough and you later get reports that the
functionality is not as you expected it to be. Take only pictures,
leave only fotprints.</P>

<H3>Always restore the assertion behavior</H3>

<P>If you change the assertion behavior, always restore it to its
original value. Be especially careful with continue, break, return,
and goto statements, as they break the linear flow of your program,
and you could accidentally skip over a
<CODE>RestoreSignalAction_</CODE> with them. Failure to comply is
hazard for your (and other people's) health.</P>
