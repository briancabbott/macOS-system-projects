 * This routine takes a ticket and associated info and calls
 * tf_save_cred() to store them in the ticket cache.  The peer
 * routine for extracting a ticket and associated info from the
 * ticket cache is krb_get_cred().  When changes are made to
 * this routine, the corresponding changes should be made
 * in krb_get_cred() as well.
 *
 * Returns KSUCCESS if all goes well, otherwise an error returned
 * by the tf_init() or tf_save_cred() routines.
 *
 * This used to just be called save_credentials, but when we formalized
 * the DOS/Mac interface, we created and exported krb_save_credentials
 * to avoid namespace pollution.
