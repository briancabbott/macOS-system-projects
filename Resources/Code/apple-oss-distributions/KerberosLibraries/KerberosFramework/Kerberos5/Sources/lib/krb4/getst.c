/*
 * getst() takes a file descriptor, a string and a count.  It reads
 * from the file until either it has read "count" characters, or until
 * it reads a null byte.  When finished, what has been read exists in
 * the given string "s".  If "count" characters were actually read, the
 * last is changed to a null, so the returned string is always null-
 * terminated.  getst() returns the number of characters read, including
 * the null terminator.
