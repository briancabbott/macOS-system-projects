 * klog() is used to add entries to the logfile (see kset_logfile()
 * below).  Note that it is probably not portable since it makes
 * assumptions about what the compiler will do when it is called
 * with less than the correct number of arguments which is the
 * way it is usually called.
 *
 * The log entry consists of a timestamp and the given arguments
 * printed according to the given "format" string.
 *
 * The log file is opened and closed for each log entry.
 *
 * If the given log type "type" is unknown, or if the log file
 * cannot be opened, no entry is made to the log file.
 *
 * The return value is always a pointer to the formatted log
 * text string "logtxt".
