<H3><A NAME="about">The edu.mit.Kerberos File</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file is where the Kerberos v4 and v5 configuration information is
stored on Mac OS X.  Formerly the Kerberos Login Library and Kerberos management application
preferences were stored in it, but they now have their own preference files: <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos.KerberosLogin.plist</CODE>
and <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos.KerberosApp.plist</CODE>.</P>

<P>The <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file stores this information in its data
fork, which contains the realm and server configuration
information (the info that would be found in the <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> file on
Unix). See the <A HREF="#pfdf">Kerberos Configuration File Format</A> section for more
information.</P>

<P>On some systems there may up to three configuration files - two <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> files
in the "system" and "user" locations, and KfM now accepts
the standard Unix location and name of <CODE>/etc/krb5.conf</CODE> for the configuration file as well.
Some settings in the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos.KerberosLogin.plist</CODE> file can override settings
in the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> as well. See the <A HREF="#locations">edu.mit.Kerberos File
Locations</A> section for more information about why this is so.</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="quickguide">Setting up a Configuration File Quick Guide</A></H3>

<P>We recommend that you read this entire page.  However, if you are in a hurry to
get Kerberos for Macintosh up and working:</P>

<P>You need to create an <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file in the <CODE>/Library/Preferences</CODE> directory which contains the realm and server configuration information for your site, although:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>if your site supports DNS configuration of Kerberos realms, you may not need
	a configuration file, or at least not a complete one - see the <A HREF="#dns">About DNS Configuration</A>
	section;</LI>
	
	<LI>if you upgraded from a previous version of Mac OS X which was using Kerberos
	successfully, you probably already have a properly configured file and no changes
	are necessary;</LI>

	<LI>if you've run the <A HREF="osx-kerberos-extras.html">Mac OS X Kerberos Extras</A> installer,
	you will already have a file in the correct place,
	but which contains MIT configuration information (which is provided as a guideline);</LI>

	<LI>if you have a functioning Mac OS 9.x Kerberos installation, you can simply copy
	the <CODE>Kerberos Preferences</CODE> file from the <CODE>Kerberos</CODE> folder
	in <CODE>Application Support</CODE> from your Mac OS 9 volume to the
	<CODE>/Library/Preferences</CODE> on your Mac OS X volume, and rename it to
	<CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you do not have an <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Launch the Kerberos application (<CODE>/System/Library/CoreServices/Kerberos</CODE>).</LI>
	<LI>Choose <B>Edit Realms...</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu.</LI>
	<LI>Use the edit realms dialog to enter information about your site's realm.  See the
		<A HREF="#config">Kerberos Configuration</A> section for information on what the various fields mean.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Note - while there may also be an <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file in your
<CODE>/Users/username/Library/Preferences</CODE> directory, you should place
your configuration information in the <CODE>/Library/Preferences</CODE>
location. (See <A HREF="#locations">edu.mit.Kerberos File Locations</A> for more
details.)</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="locations">edu.mit.Kerberos File Locations</A></H3>

<P>Kerberos for Macintosh supports and looks for its configuration file in three locations -
two are standard locations and the third for Unix compatibility:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><CODE>/Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> - the standard "system" location 
	that contains the configuration to be used by all users of the computer,</LI>
	
	<LI><CODE>/Users/username/Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> - the standard "user"
	location containing additional configuration for an individual user,</LI>
	
	<LI><CODE>/etc/krb5.conf</CODE> - the Unix compatibility location.  Any configuration file in this location will
	also apply to all users of the computer.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The typical case is to have the Kerberos configuration information in
the standard system configuration file, and no user configuration
file or Unix compatibility file.</P>

<P>However there may be circumstances where a user wants to have additional
realm and server information not shared with other users on the same machine.
You can add any additional realm and server configuration information to the
user configuration file, and KfM will meld the two sets of information
together.  You should avoid duplicate realm entries - if you have the same
entry with different information in different configuration files, the behavior is
not defined and you may get unexpected results.  </P>

<P>If the user wants to have additional items in the <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> section,
it's important to be aware of the order in which KfM reads the configuration files,
because in case of conflicting <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> entries, the entry read
first is the one that KfM will use (this is different from the situation with realm
entries, which are merged).  KfM first reads the configuration file in the user location, then the one
in the system location, and finally the Unix compatibility location.</P>

<P>Similarly, if there is a configuration file in the Unix compatibility location,
KfM will attempt to meld those the information in it together with any other
configuration files present, with behavior as described above.</P>

<P>Having just a user configuration file and no system configuration file is not a
supported setup.  For instance, getting Kerberos tickets at login time will not work
if you only have a user configuration file.  The Mac OS X login window will not read 
the user configuration file.</P>

<P>Note: some settings in the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos.KerberosLogin.plist</CODE>, the
Kerberos Login Library preferences file, can effectively override settings in
the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file.
These settings can be modified using the Kerberos GUI management application
<CODE>/System/Library/Coreservices/Kerberos</CODE> .</P>

<P>Generally, site settings go in the <CODE>/Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file, and
user settings will go into <CODE>~/Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos.KerberosLogin.plist</CODE>
(via changing settings in Kerberos.app). The Kerberos Login preferences exist so that the user can change
their ticket management preferences without changing those preferences for every user on the machine.
One user might always want addressless tickets, but another user might not.  </P>

<P>In addition, there are some options which cannot be set with the <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE>
section of the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file.  For instance, there is no <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> 
file preference to set the default ticket lifetime - despite config files which claim
there is a "ticket_lifetime" tag, no code actually looks for it.  </P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="config">Kerberos Configuration Information</A></H3>

<P>A Kerberos configuration is made up of a list of realms and a list of domain->realm mappings.</P>

<P>Each realm entry contains a list of servers and a default domain for the realm.  Each type of server has a different purpose.  "kdc" servers are used to obtain tickets.  "admin" servers are used to perform administrator operations, such as running kadmin.  At most sites there will only be one admin server per Kerberos realm.  "kpasswd" servers are used to change your password, although the admin server will be used if no kpasswd server is listed.  "krb524" servers are used to get v4 tickets from v5 tickets and are only used by v5 realms.</P>

<P>If the realm and site DNS domain are different, there will also be domain to realm mappings.  For instance, if you have a domain-realm mapping ".mydepartment.mysite.com = MYSITE.COM" and try to contact a server such as "myprinter.mydepartment.mysite.com", Kerberos will know to contact the realm "MYSITE.COM" rather than the default, "MYDEPARTMENT.MYSITE.COM".</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="pfdf">The Kerberos Configuration File Format</A></H3>

<P> The Kerberos v4 and v5 configurations are stored in the data fork of <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE>.</P>

<P>This text is similar to that of <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> on Unix machines or <CODE>krb5.ini</CODE> on Windows machines.  
The configuration tells Kerberos for Macintosh what realms exist,
what Kerberos versions are supported by them, and where to find the servers.  You should
edit this file for your site by opening the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file in a text editor that 
will save the file as pure text again, ie: BBEdit, emacs, or CodeWarrior; but not TextEdit (unless
you use the "Make Plain Text" command) or Microsoft Word.</P>

<P>Once you are done editing the <CODE>edu.mit.Kerberos</CODE> file, you should log out,
and then you may want to use the <a href="../../KerberosClients/KerberosApp/Documentation/using-osx.html#realms">Edit Favorite Realms</a>
feature of the Kerberos management application to add your realms to the pop-up menu in the Login dialog. </P>

<P> Here is an example Kerberos configuration: </P>
	
<PRE>
	[libdefaults]
		default_realm = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
		noaddresses = TRUE

	[realms]
	        ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
	                kdc = kerberos.mit.edu.:88
	                kdc = kerberos-1.mit.edu.:88
	                kdc = kerberos-2.mit.edu.:88
	                admin_server = kerberos.mit.edu.
	                default_domain = mit.edu
	        }
	        MEDIA-LAB.MIT.EDU = {
	                kdc = kerberos.media.mit.edu.
	                admin_server = kerberos.media.mit.edu.
	        }

	[domain_realm]
		.mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
		mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
		.media.mit.edu = MEDIA-LAB.MIT.EDU
		media.mit.edu = MEDIA-LAB.MIT.EDU

	[v4 realms]
	        ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
	                kdc = kerberos.mit.edu.
	                kdc = kerberos-1.mit.edu.
	                kdc = kerberos-2.mit.edu.
	                admin_server = kerberos.mit.edu.
	                default_domain = mit.edu
	        }
	        UMICH.EDU = {
	                kdc = kerberos.umich.edu.
	                admin_server = kerberos.umich.edu.
	                default_domain = umich.edu
	        }

	[v4 domain_realm]
		.mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
		mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
		.umich.edu = UMICH.EDU
		umich.edu = UMICH.EDU</PRE>
		
<P>The <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> section describes what the default behavior of the Kerberos 
libraries should be.  You should always fill in the default realm.  If you have Kerberos 
v5 at your site, you should also copy any other <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> from your site's
<CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> or <CODE>krb5.ini</CODE>.</P>

<P>Kerberos for Macintosh 5.5 now honors <CODE>ticket_lifetime</CODE> entries in
<CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> .  However, if you have set a ticket lifetime default in the GUI Kerberos management
application preferences, it will override this value.</P>

<P>The <CODE>[realms]</CODE> and <CODE>[domain_realm]</CODE> sections refer to Kerberos v5 realms.
If your site is v4-only you should omit these sections.  Otherwise just copy these sections from
your site's <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> or <CODE>krb5.ini</CODE>.</P>

<P>The <CODE>[v4 realms]</CODE> and <CODE>[v4 domain_realm]</CODE> sections refer to Kerberos v4 
realms.  If your site is v5-only you should omit these sections.  Otherwise you will need to
create entries for each of the Kerberos v4 realms at your site.  You should not specify a
string_to_key_type for v4 realms anymore, because that information will be ignored - KfM
will automatically determine the correct one to use.</P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="dns">DNS Configuration</A></H3>

<P>Some sites have configured their DNS servers to provide information about local Kerberos realm
configuration, such that users need only a minimum configuration file and instead can get
the rest of the Kerberos configuration information over the network.
For more information about DNS, see the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.6/krb5-1.6.1/doc/krb5-admin.html#Using%20DNS">Using DNS</A>
section of the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.6/krb5-1.6.1/doc/krb5-admin.html">Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide</A>.</P>

<P>You should always have a configuration file that has a <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> section
with a <CODE>default_realm</CODE> specified.  Otherwise, getting Kerberos tickets at login
time may fail.</P>

<P>If your Kerberos realm is named the same as your domain name, e.g. your domain name = foo.bar.edu and
your Kerberos realm = FOO.BAR.EDU, you do not need any more information in your local configuration
file, assuming all the realms you need to access have DNS records.</P>

<P>Otherwise, you also need a <CODE>[domain_realm]</CODE> section, mapping your domain to the appropriate
realms.  You can omit the <CODE>[realms]</CODE> sections of the configuration file.</P>

<P>DNS configuration of realms only applies to Kerberos v5, so unless your site does krb524 on the server,
you will need to include v4 information in a local configuration file.</P>

<P>If you want to disable DNS lookup of Kerberos realms on your Macintosh, uncheck the "Configure additional realms automatically using DNS" checkbox in the Kerberos application's edit realms dialog or add the line:</P>

<PRE>dns_fallback = no</PRE>

<P>to the <CODE>[libdefaults]</CODE> section of your Kerberos configuration file.</P>
