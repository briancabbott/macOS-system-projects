24-Aug-2005
	diffstat 1.41

	update usage message for options added in 1.40 (report by Eric Blake).

15-Aug-2005
	diffstat 1.40

	add options -l, -r and -t.  add to -f option (patch, comments by
	Jean Delvare, Michael Burian).

	improve I/O on Linux using fgetc_locked().

	improve searching of long sorted lists using tsearch()

	improve configure-script checks for Intel compiler warnings.

10-Apr-2005
	diffstat 1.39

	change order of merging and prefix-stripping so stripping all prefixes,
	e.g., with -p9, will be sorted as expected (patch by Jean Delvare).

	correct a reference to freed memory after merging found with valgrind.

16-Jan-2005
	diffstat 1.38

	add makefile.wnt, etc., for win32 port.

	fix "make check" to work even when PATH or the build directory has
	spaces in it (patch by Eric Blake).

	add support for '--help' and '--version' command line arguments, for a
	consistent interface with GNU tools, and still compatible to POSIX
	requirements on utility options (patch by Eric Blake).

18-Dec-2004

	modify makefile.in and run_test.sh to allow "make check" to be run from
	a build directory which is not the same as the source directory, i.e.,
	when the configure --srcdir option is used (request by Eric Blake).

	modify distribution to include sample of regression tests, so a
	"make check" will work (request by Eric Blake).

16-Dec-2004
	diffstat 1.37

	fix a different case for data beginning with "--" which was treated as
	a header line.

14-Dec-2004
	diffstat 1.36

	Fix allocation problems.  Open files in binary mode for reading.
	Getopt returns -1, not necessarily EOF.  Add const where useful.  Use
	NO_IDENT where necessary.  malloc() comes from <stdlib.h> in standard
	systems (Patch by Eric Blake <ebb9@byu.net>.)

08-Nov-2004
	diffstat 1.35

	modify makefile.in to work with configure --srcdir option (report by
	Eric Blake).

	minor fix for resync of unified diffs checks for range (line beginning
	with '@' without header lines (successive lines beginning with "---"
	and "+++") (Debian #264098).

	miscellaneous updates for configure script

09-Nov-2003
	diffstat 1.34

	improve check for certain lines (not those that begin a chunk) that
	begin with '-', treating all except "---" as a delete (report by
	James Rowe <Jay@jnrowe.uklinux.net>).

	minor updates to configure script.

14-Feb-2003
	diffstat 1.33

	modified to work around a case where the filename+date was incomplete,
	i.e., missing one of the components such as the day of the month.
	While diffstat does not use the date directly, it helps distinguish
	some lines from non-patches (report by Moritz Barsnick
	<moritz@barsnick.net>).

	add "-h" option (request by Moritz Barsnick).

	fix a typo in usage message (report by Moritz Barsnick).

	add "-e" and "-o" options to simplify testing on OS/2 EMX.

04-Jan-2003
	diffstat 1.32

	modified to handle patches generated by makepatch-2.00_09, which uses
	both "Index" and "diff" lines (report by D Roland Walker).  As a side
	effect, the additional merging eliminates occasional reports with
	zero differences.

	modified to avoid buffer overflows.

	fixes for Debian #155000 (did not handle a '-' in first content-column
	of a unified diff) and #170947 (option to turn the progress messages
	off).

	update configure script using aclocal.m4 macros

	update makefile.in to improve use of autoconf (report/patch by Nix
	<nix@esperi.demon.co.uk>).

20-Aug-2002
	diffstat 1.31

	add -u, -k options to override diffstat's normal sorting (-u) and
	merging (-k) of identical filenames.  (-u requested by H Peter Anvin
	<hpa@zytor.com>).

09-Aug-2002
	diffstat 1.30

	allow either '/' or '-' as delimiters in dates, to accommodate gendiff
	(report by Rik van Riel <riel@conectiva.com.br>).  This corresponds to
	the time format used in diffutils 2.8 whose changelog states that this
	is ISO 8601 (though online references differ).

10-Oct-2001
	diffstat 1.29

	add bzip2 (.bz2) suffix as suggested by Gregory T Norris
	<haphazard@socket.net> in Debian bug report #82969).

	add check for diff from RCS archive where the "diff" lines do not
	reference a filename.

29-Mar-2000
	diffstat 1.28

	Add -c option (to prefix output with '#' comment), eliminating a step
	in my script that combines diffstat output with a patch.  This is a
	workaround for OSF1's broken sed utility.

	Check for compressed file suffixes .Z and .gz, read uncompressed data
	via pipe (Debian wishlist item #53975 by ch@lathspell.westend.com).

	Simplified makefile based on comments by M Sweger
	<mikesw@whiterose.net>

	Adapted changes from Troy Engel <tengel@sonic.net> as "-f" option.

27-May-1998
	diffstat 1.27

	Debian diff's don't show dates on the lines where we expect to see
	filenames.

Patch 5 (16-Jan-1998)
	diffstat 1.26

	Change copyright terms.

 	Accommodate patches w/o tabs in header lines (e.g., from cut/paste).
	Still prefer the tabs because otherwise we cannot have spaces in
	filenames.

 	Strip suffixes such as ".orig", to avoid confusing output.

Patch 4 (16-Mar-1996)
	diffstat 1.24

	Corrected state-transition after "Binary".

	Added testing subdirectory

	Added -p option.

	Handle differences from /tmp (e.g., for X11R5 patches).

Patch 3 (06-May-1995)

	Repost whole program to comp.sources.misc (1.17)

	Mods to scaling: limit to 1:1 if only a few changes were made; added
	logic to accumulate error across +/-/!  calls.

	added logic to recognize 'rcsdiff -u' output.

Patch 2 (26-Dec-1994)

	Strip common pathname prefix (1.15)

Patch 1 (13-Nov-1994)

	Test for <string.h> vs <strings.h>

	Corrected error in 'match()' that didn't handle properly the case when
	an argument was a null string (i.e., blank lines in a unified diff).

	Added options '-n' and '-V'

	Added patchlev.h, CHANGES files.

	Added install.sh, for autoconf 2.1


Patch 0 (13-Jun-1994)

	Initial release of 'diffstat' (1.12).
