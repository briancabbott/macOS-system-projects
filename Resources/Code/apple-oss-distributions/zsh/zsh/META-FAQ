The Zsh Userguide
-----------------

A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current state at
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/.  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete.
