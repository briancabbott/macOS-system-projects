Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad tt(<pf@zsh.org>).
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing
list tt(<zsh-workers@zsh.org>).  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson tt(<pws@zsh.org>).  The coordinator
can be contacted at tt(<coordinator@zsh.org>), but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list.

texinode(The Zsh Userguide)(See Also)(The Zsh Web Page)(Introduction)
sect(The Zsh Userguide)
A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current state at
uref(http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/).  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete.
