/*
 * audit_session_mksend
 *
 * Description: Obtain a send right for given audit session.
 *
 * Parameters:	*aia_p		Audit session information to assosiate with
 *                              the new port.
 *              *sessionport	Pointer to the current session port.  This may
 *                              actually be set to IPC_PORT_NULL.
 *
 * Returns:	!NULL		Resulting send right.
 *              NULL		Failed to allocate port (due to lack of memory
 *                              resources).
 *
 * Assumptions: Caller holds a reference on the session during the call.
 *		If there were no outstanding send rights against the port,
 *		hold a reference on the session and arm a new no-senders
 *		notification to determine when to release that reference.
 *		Otherwise, by creating an additional send right, we share
 *		the port's reference until all send rights go away.
