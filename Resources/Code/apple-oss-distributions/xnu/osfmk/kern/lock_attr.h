 * The attribute needs to be set before calling lck_rw_init().
 * This attribute changes the locking behaviour by possibly starving the writers.
 * Readers will always be able to lock the lock as long as a writer is not holding it.
 * This attribute was added to allow recursive locking in shared mode.
