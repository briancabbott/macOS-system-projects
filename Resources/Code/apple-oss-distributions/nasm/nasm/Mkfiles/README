These are pre-created Makefiles for various platforms, use them if
GNU autoconf/automake packages are not supported on your system.

Copy appropriate Makefile to ../Makefile, look at it to see if there
are any edits that need to be made, and run make.

Some of these Makefiles have been contributed by end users, and the
NASM team has no way of knowing if they work correctly or not.  For
that reason, there are sometimes multiple Makefiles for the same
platform.  Look at the comments at the beginning to help select a
Makefile for your particular system.


The Makefiles are:

  Filename      Target		Compiler	Notes
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Makefile.b32	Win32	    	Borland C++	OK as of NASM 0.98.37
  Makefile.bc3	16-bit DOS  	Borland C++	OK as of NASM 0.98.34
  Makefile.bor	16-bit DOS  	Turbo C		(**)
  Makefile.dj	32-bit DOS  	DJGPP		OK as of NASM 0.98.37
  Makefile.djo	32-bit DOS  	DJGPP		"Opus Make" version(**)
  Makefile.dl	32-bit DOS  	cc386		cc386 by David Lindauer
  Makefile.dos	16-bit DOS	MSC 5		(**)
  Makefile.ms7	16-bit DOS	MSC 7		OK as of NASM 0.98.31
  Makefile.os2	OS/2 Warp	Borland C++	(**)
  Makefile.sc	32-bit DOS	Symantec C++ 7
  Makefile.scw	Win32		Symantec C++ 7
  Makefile.unx	Unix		Any(*)		use only if "configure" fails
  Makefile.vc	Win32		MS Visual C++	OK as of NASM 0.98.32
  Makefile.wc	32-bit DOS	Watcom C	(**)
  Makefile.wcd	16-bit DOS	OpenWatcom C	OK as of NASM 0.98.37
  Makefile.wcw	Win32		Watcom C	(**)


(*) = This Makefile should work with any compiler which is ANSI
      C89/ISO C90 compliant and that uses the standard Unix compiler
      arguments, such as -c, -o, -I and -O.  Pre-ANSI compilers,
      such as the "cc" distributed with SunOS 4.x, will not work.
      If you find a system on which you need to use this, please write
      <nasm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> and tell us which system.

(**) = Probably obsolete, needs updating.
