 If given, \fBrotatelogs\fR will execute the specified program every time a new log file is opened\&. The filename of the newly opened file is passed as the first argument to the program\&. If executing after a rotation, the old log file is passed as the second argument\&. \fBrotatelogs\fR does not wait for the specified program to terminate before continuing to operate, and will not log any error code returned on termination\&. The spawned program uses the same stdin, stdout, and stderr as rotatelogs itself, and also inherits the environment\&.
