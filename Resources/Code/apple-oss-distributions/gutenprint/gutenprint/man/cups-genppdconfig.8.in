.TH CUPS\-GENPPDCONFIG "8" "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GUTENPRINT_VERSION@" "Gutenprint Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
cups\-genppdconfig \- a user-friendly interface to generate Gutenprint PPD files for use with CUPS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cups\-genppdconfig
[\fI\-d ppd_directory\fR]
.br
.B update\-cups\-genppd
[\fI\-d pdd_directory\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcups\-genppdconfig\fR generates \fIGutenprint\fR PPD files for use with CUPS.
The program allows the selection of the base directory to create the PPDs in,
and the printers and languages desired.  The default settings are taken from
the contents of the base directory.  Note that unselecting an item will
\fBnot\fP remove it from the disk; you must remove unwanted printers and
languages by deleting the files and directories respectively.
.PP
If \fBdialog\fP is installed, it will be used to create the user interface,
using colour, 3D-look dialog boxes etc.  If dialog cannot be found, perlmenu
will be used instead to create a simpler, though functionally identical,
interface.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d \fIppd-directory\fP
Use \fIppd-directory\fP as the base directory to create PPD files in.  The
default printer and language selections will also be obtained from this
directory.  By default, the base directory is
\fP@cups_conf_datadir@/model/gutenprint\fP.
