    <p><em>The JBossMX monitor services</em>.

    <h2>Package Specification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The monitor services allow notifications to be sent when
          attribute values change. The notification is NOT done in
          real time, rather the value is polled at regular intervals.
          Notifications are also sent when the monitoring cannot be
          performed for various reasons.
      </li>
      <li>The monitor services are registered as separate MBeans for
          each attribute. Any number of notification listeners can be
          added to these services, to perform the required operations.
      </li>
      <li>The <i>CounterMonitor</i> is used for "integer" attributes that 
          only increase, except for modulus behaviour (e.g. a 24 hour clock).
      </li>
      <li>The <i>GaugeMonitor</i> is used for numeric attributes that can
          both increase and decrease.
      </li>
      <li>The <i>StringMonitor</i> is used for any attribute to check for
          a matching or differing value.
      </li>
    </ul>
      
    <h2>Related Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>TODO: get the link for the JMX specification.
