A <b>Web Service</b> is a unit of application logic providing data and services to 
other applications. Applications access Web Services via ubiquitous Web protocols and data 
formats such as HTTP, XML, and SOAP, with no need to worry about how each Web Service 
is implemented. Web Services combine the best aspects of component-based development 
and the Web ...

<p class="text"> In addition, Web Services can be characterised through their ability to 
describe themselves in a platform-independent, XML-based meta-language such as WSDL 
(Web Service Description Language) and their ability to federate through global, platform-independent, and 
XML-based registries such as UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery Integration).

Web Services and J2EE are an ideal match. J2EE is a mature and

<p class="head">Features and release plan

<p class="text"> 
<img SRC="pictures/axis.jpg" align=right> 

Jboss.net is currently released under 1.0 and has 
been adopting the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis">Apache Axis</a> 
package (Release Candidate 1, installed under 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jboss/thirdparty/apache/axis/">thirdParty/apache/axis</a>).

Axis is a clean-room successor to <a href="http://xml.apache.org/soap/">Apache-SOAP 2.0</a> and comes with a 
well-configurable, JAXRPC-compatible processing architecture that is quite similar to the JBoss container 
concept (see the above overview slides). We aim to fit the Axis code optimally into the JBoss hot-deploying environment 
such that MBeans and EJB큦 can be straightforwardly exposed as Web Services and such that the basic 
J2EE-related use-cases are supported. 
 
<p class="text"> The current features include:

<ul>

<li class="text"> 
The <code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.AxisService</code> MBean installs the basic Axis invocation engine to which the 
dedicated transport servlet located in the embedded jboss-net.war talks to (has been tested with both <a ref="jboss-jetty.jsp">Jetty</a> and <a ref="jboss-tomcat.jsp">Tomcat</a>). 
(The <code>org.jboss.net.axis.AxisInvocationHandler</code> that should originally ease the 
construction of detached (dynamic) client proxies is deprecated and will soon vanish since the reflection
meta-data are too small for connecting to real-world web services ... rather we recommend using stubs as generated 
by the wsdl2java tool and as integrated using the external web-service reference feature - see below).
</li>

<li class="text"> 
The AxisService MBean functions as a (hot-)deployer  for so-called <em>Web Service aRchive</em> (WSR- or .wsr-) files. 
These are ordinary .jar files that contain, besides necessary byte code for plugging into the Axis machinery, a 
slightly extended <a ref="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/xml-axis/java/docs/user-guide.html">Web Service Deployment Descriptor (WSDD)</a> 
in their &quot;META-INF/web-service.xml&quot; entry.
</li>

<li class="text"> 
JBoss.Net contains a dedicated <code>org.jboss.net.jmx.server.MBeanProvider</code>
handler that maps Web Service invocations directly to dedicated MBeans on the JMX bus. Similar to
the JMX way of invocation, any Web Method starts with a String-Array describing the signature of
the target Java method followed by the proper arguments. The corresponding
<code>org.jboss.net.jmx.MBeanInvocationHandler</code> is also provided. Implemented, but not yet 
fully tested, is the automatic WSDL (Web Service Description Language) emmission for such web services from the
JMX meta-information.
</li>

<li class="text"> 
An example for an MBean-based Web Service is preinstalled through the embedded jmx-net.wsr. The <code>org.jboss.net.jmx.adaptor.server.RemoteAdapter</code> 
which exposes the full MBeanServer functionality as a Web Service (for client-side acccess you can use, e.g., the 
<code>org.jboss.net.jmx.adaptor.RemoteAdaptor</code> interface and the <code>org.jboss.net.jmx.adaptor.RemoteAdaptorInvocationHandler</code>
factory). Some of the relevant java types, such as javax.management.ObjectName and javax.management.Attribute, already have
a reasonable typemapping installed for that purpose. 
</li>

<li class="text"> 
A specialised <code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.EJBProvider</code> allows to interface/map 
Web Service invocations immediately to session beans. For that purpose, .wsr files can 
be deployed as &quot;client applications&quot; within .ear files (&lt;java/&gt; modules). We allow 
&quot;&lt;ejb-ref\&gt;&quot; entries in the Axis deployment descriptor to link the 
naming environments of the Web Service to the corresponding EJB큦. This is exactly the same
mechanism that is usually used in the web.xml descriptor for being able to reroute bean-lookups 
without changing the Servlet-code (see the WebContainer HowTo for that purpose). However, since there is usually
no code involved in exposing a web-service, this feature may dissappear in some future version. 
</li>

<li class="text"> 
Stateful Session Beans can be reasonably treated by, e.g., maintaining a persistent http-session with the 
web-server which is the default mode of the AxisInvocationHandler. When deploying the web-service with the
correct session-scope (as opposed to the usual call-scope), subsequent calls to the same AxisInvocationHandler will 
hence hit the same (maybe stateful) session bean reference stored in the message scope. Proper Lifecycle
handling in the JAXRPC/Axis message scope will trigger the EJBs` remove() method when leaving the scope.
scope
</li>

<li class="text"> 
For the called web-service to correctly behave in the JBoss container, it is required that
the calling thread (usually taken from the WebServer큦 threadpool) is associated with the correct classloader , i.e., 
the deployment classloader of the targetted service. For this purpose, we have fixedly installed two handlers 
<code>org.jboss.net.axis.SetClassLoaderHandler</code> and
<code>org.jboss.net.axis.ResetClassLoaderHandler</code> in the server큦 http transport chain. The first handler is installed
in the requestFlow and 
remembers the old classloader in the messagecontext and associated the thread with the target service큦 deployment classloader. 
The latter is installed in the responseFlow and resets the association to the old loader after a successful call. Upon failure in each flow, 
both handlers are able to reset the association.
</li>

<li class="text"> 
Axis and JBoss Security models are connected via the two handlers <code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.JBossAuthenticationHandler</code> and
<code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.JBossAuthorizationHandler</code>. The first one is installed per-default in the http-transport
chain and maps the basic authentication data that has been extracted by a preceeding <code>org.apache.axis.transports.http.HTTPAuthHandler</code> 
to a given JBoss security domain (as specified as a JNDI name in the handlers "securityDomain" parameter). The latter handler can
be inserted in the requestFlow of your particular Web-service to mimique a unix-style allow/denied roles authorization scheme (parameter
"securityDomain" as before, parameters "allowedRoles" and "deniedRoles" for controlling access to the 
specified web service. See the servers axis-config.xml for that purpose.
</li>

<li class="text"> 
You usually would not want to expose your Entity Beans as Web Services themselves for the same reasons as you
usually do not expose references to client applications for fine-grained access. Instead you usually apply
the Value-Object-Pattern to stream the entity bean state to the client and to impose the returned modifications on 
that state back to the entity instance. This is possible by using a combination of the Axis-BeanSerializer and the
<code>org.jboss.axis.server.EntityBeanDeserializer</code>. The Deserializer is given a particular find method
and corresponding attributes from the entity큦 state, such as the primary key attribute, which are the parameters to the 
find method. During Deserialization, it will first obtain these attribute to get a reference to the entity instance through 
the home interface and the find method and afterwards will set the remaining attributes and elements from the structure. This way, even
if your application has not yet been designed using value objects, e.g., because it is yet used with a browser-based 
GUI and the WebContainer is hosted in-VM, you can easily extend it into a web-service. 
</li>

<li class="text"> 
Since the Entity Bean serialisation process will be deeply integrated with the persistence engine, it is also important to 
cater about transactional isolation. Usually, the deserialized and serialized data should be consistent with
the transactional context within the called method. For that purpose, the <code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.JBossTxHandler</code>
and the <code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.JBossResetTxHandler</code> will spawn a minimal user transaction around the
exposed Web-Service, or particular methods of the Web-Service. the <code>org.jboss.net.axis.server.JbossForceSerHandler</code> is used
 to ensure that serialisation is indeed done within the transaction borders.
</li>

<li class="text"> 
To deal with external web services, such as the well known Google and BabelFish services, that 
are very useful to be called from within your POJOs, MBeans or EJBeans, there is now the possibility
to deploy web service stubs into the server큦 JNDI tree. The &quot;ext-service&quot; tag inside the 
deployment descriptor lets AxisService construct and bind javax.xml.rpc.Service instances into your JNDI tree. 
See the &quot;external&quot; example in the testsuite that federates Google and Babelfish into a 
combined session bean. (Remember to set the -Dhttp.proxyHost -Dhttp.proxyPort -Dhttp.proxyUser and -Dhttp.proxyPassword in the
jboss startup file when running this test from behind your corporate firewall!) 
</li>

<li class="text"> 
Macromedia decided that they would have some close-to-but-not-quite-that-close-to-standard SOAP support in their
Flash5 plugin (maybe in order to sell their dedicated app-servers at the backends????). There came Frederik and
shook Axis so long as to talk to these special, browser-based clients. For that purpose, you would have to
uncomment a dedicated FlashAxisServiceServlet line in jboss-net.sar!META-INF/install-axis.xml (comment out the
usual AxisServiceServlet instead) and install a dedicated FlashNamespaceHandler in the http response flow of 
jboss-net.sar!axis-config.xml You will find a sample flash application under samples/src/flash (warning, you have to 
switch the service address to axis/services with the default configuration of jboss.net). Since Flash does not like the SOAP-ENV namespace annotations which are removed by that 
handler, you can currently configure jboss.net to either talk default SOAP or talk Flash-SOAP. We are working on
a solution that allows both types of accesses through different URL-contexts but at the same service providers. 
This is going to be great!
</li>

<li class="text"> 
We provide an <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net">XDoclet</a>-module that generates the web-service.xml 
from correctly tagged beans (tags are e.g., @jboss-net:web-service and @jboss-net:web-method) and data-objects 
(@jboss-net:xml-schema) for you.
</li>

</ul>

JBoss.Net is strongly connected to features of Jboss 3.0 (Rabbit Hole) and hence,  
we try to synchronize with its release plan. The official release of JBoss.Net 1.0 will be included
in the JBoss3.2.0 release. We are seeking any available help 
for testing the existing code, constructing a detailed requirement list, and 
implementing features! See the <a ref="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=13975&group_id=22866&func=browse">Todo&Assignment List</a> 
and make your development skills immortal! 

<p class="text"> Plans for the 2.0 release include adherence to the EJB2.1 specification wrt. EJB-related 
web service  features and will address advanced issues 
like adopting the pending XML-related JSR큦 (Java API for XML DataBinding - JAXB, 
Java API for XML Remote Procedure Call - JAX-RPC, Java API for XML Messaging - JAXM, 
Java API for XML Registries - JAXR), introducing lightweight Internet Transactions and
providing more sophisticated bean interaction patterns. Eventually, we will also provide basic
C#-, or .Net-Code that will speed up your building of Microsoft-enabled client applications.

<p class="head">How to build, install and use Jboss.net

<p class="text"> Before you go on writing your first Web Service in Java, we recommend 
that you have a look at code and meta-data samples at 
<link href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/">the axis site</a>. 

<p class="text"> <em>To build</em>, you can run either 

<code>
<pre>
cd build
build -Dmodules=jboss.net
</pre>
</code>

or

<code>
<pre>
cd build
build -Dgroups=plugins
</pre>
</code>

or 

<code>
<pre>
cd build
build -Dgroups=optional
</pre>
</code>

or (this is for our friends of logical progression ;-)

<code>
<pre>
cd build
build -Dgroups=optional-plugins
</pre>
</code>

<p class="text"> <em> To install </em>: JBoss.net relies requires a WebContainer 
installation (Tomcat, Jetty; JBoss.net has currently been tested under Jetty) to realize 
the http transport facility. The necessary runtime libraries (lib/ext/axis.jar, deploy/lib/jboss-net.sar and
client/jboss-net-client.jar) and configuration files  (conf/default/axis-config.xml and client/client-config.xml)
are installed as a part of the above BUILD step.
	 
<p class="text">AxisService will register itself as a .wsr deployer at the <code>org.jboss.system.MainDeployer</code>, hence simply putting a .wsr file (or a .wsr file embedded into some other 
hierarchically structured deployment package, such as an .ear) into your deploy directory is enough. 
If you would like to configure JBoss.net with a different WebContainer, please replace the dependency and 
WarDeployer references in deploy/lib/jboss-net.sar!META_INF/jboss-service.xml (the way that 
code and deployment descriptors are bundled is likely and hopefully to change in RH!) 
by your favorite servlet-runner:

<pre>

&lt;server&gt;

  &lt;mbean code=&quot;org.jboss.net.axis.server.AxisService&quot;
	 name=&quot;jboss.net:service=Axis&quot;&gt;
    &lt;depends&gt;jboss.web:service=Jetty&lt;/depends&gt;
    &lt;attribute name=&quot;WarDeployerName&quot;&gt;jboss.web:service=Jetty&lt;/attribute&gt;
    &lt;attribute name=&quot;RootContext&quot;&gt;axis/&lt;/attribute&gt;
    &lt;attribute name=&quot;SecurityDomain&quot;&gt;java:/jaas/other&lt;/attribute&gt;
  &lt;/mbean&gt;

&lt;/server&gt;
</pre>
	
<p class="text"><em>To test</em>: The successfull installation of JBoss.net will be reported 
during the JBoss boot process (The WebContainer should acknowledge the deployment of 
the _axis_\&lt;RootContext/&gt; web application including the main AxisServlet, where
&lt;RootContext/&gt; is the configurable URL infix that defaults to axis/ and under which the 
deployed Web-Services can be reached, see above).

<p class="text">After that, pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-net/servlet/AxisServlet">http://localhost:8080/jboss-net/servlet/AxisServlet</a> 
(or an equivalent address depending on the configuration of your WebContainer and the RootContext) 
should return the default "hello" response page of the AxisServlet. 

<p class="text">When you start JBoss with the -Daxis.enableListQuery=true option (which you usually do not in a security-aware 
productive environment), a <a href="http://localhost:8080/axis/services?list">http://localhost:8080/jboss-net/services?list</a>  
request should return an xml document describing the current configuration of the AxisEngine including the
deployed services. The services section should look like:

<pre>
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt; 
  &lt;deployment xmlns="http://xml.apache.org/axis/wsdd/" xmlns:java="http://xml.apache.org/axis/wsdd/providers/java"&gt;
  &lt;service name="RemoteAdaptor" provider="Handler"&gt;
  &lt;parameter name="handlerClass" value="org.jboss.net.jmx.server.MBeanProvider" /&gt; 
  &lt;parameter name="ObjectName" value="jboss.net:service=Adaptor" /&gt; 
  &lt;/service&gt;
  &lt;service name="Administration" provider="java:MSG"&gt;
  &lt;parameter name="allowedMethods" value="AdminService" /&gt; 
  &lt;parameter name="isStatic" value="true" /&gt; 
  &lt;parameter name="methodName" value="AdminService" /&gt; 
  &lt;parameter name="enableRemoteAdmin" value="false" /&gt; 
  &lt;parameter name="className" value="org.apache.axis.utils.Admin" /&gt; 
  &lt;/service&gt;
  &lt;transport name="http"&gt;
  &lt;requestFlow&gt;
  &lt;handler type="java:org.apache.axis.handlers.http.HTTPActionHandler" /&gt; 
  &lt;handler type="java:org.apache.axis.handlers.http.URLMapper" /&gt; 
  &lt;handler type="java:org.apache.axis.handlers.http.HTTPAuthHandler" /&gt; 
  &lt;handler type="java:org.jboss.net.axis.SetClassLoaderHandler" /&gt; 
  &lt;handler type="java:org.jboss.net.axis.server.JBossAuthenticationHandler" /&gt; 
  &lt;/requestFlow&gt;
  &lt;responseFlow&gt;
  &lt;handler type="java:org.jboss.net.axis.ResetClassLoaderHandler" /&gt; 
  &lt;/responseFlow&gt;
  &lt;/transport&gt;
  &lt;typeMapping encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" serializer="org.jboss.net.jmx.adaptor.ObjectNameSerializerFactory" deserializer="org.jboss.net.jmx.adaptor.ObjectNameDeserializerFactory" type="java:javax.management.ObjectName" qname="ns1:ObjectNameType" xmlns:ns1="http://net.jboss.org/jmx" /&gt; 
  &lt;/deployment&gt;
</pre>

<p class="text">We recognize inter alia the already mentioned end-point of the RemoteAdaptor web service that
is mapped (via the <code>org.jboss.net.jmx.server.MBeanProvider</code>) to a dedicated MBean with JMX-ObjectName "jboss.net:service=Adaptor". 
Indeed, if you have a look at your <a ref="http://localhost:8082/">current JMX state</a> there
should be the corresponding service up and running, ready to take your Web Invocations through
the JMX bus.

<p class="text">In the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jboss/contrib/jboss.net/testsuite/">JBoss.net testsuite</a>,
we have assembled some samples and tests that can serve as an inspiration and source of insight. 
You can build and run the testsuite against a running jboss server as follows (after having built the main jboss-all/testsuite!)

<code>
<pre>
cd jboss.net/testsuite
build tests-standard-unit
</pre>
</code>

<p class="text">In the output directory, there will be some deployable Web Services
(output/lib/addr.wsr is the JBoss-compatible package containing the Axis Address example, output/lib/hello.ear
is a J2EE application consisting of the hello ejb module from the JBoss main testsuite and
an additional web service layer on top of the HelloBean). In output/bin we also have put
some (non-functional, arrgh) batch files to run the individual tests. 

<p class="text">Under samples/win, we have checked-in a tiny C#/.Net-based client application that can be run against
the advanced store-test from the above testsuite. You can play around especially with the "Add Web Reference" 
functionality to see how programming against the live server and the wsdl-descriptions can be achieved. For example, 
you can access the meta-data of the BusinessPartnerService bean under 
<a href="http://localhost:8080:/axis/services/BusinessPartnerService?wsdl">http://localhost:8080:/jboss-net/services/BusinessPartnerService?wsdl</a> once
the store.ear is deployed.
