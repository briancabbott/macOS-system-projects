BUILD SEQUENCE

Read the build/INSTALL file for a generic set of instructions on
how to operate the Ant installation process.

REQUIRED COMPONENTS

All required components are shipped as jars in the lib directory.  

RUNNING JBOSSMQ

Each distribution has it's own directory under bin, once compiled.
Refer to the README in that directory for specific instructions on testing and running the server.  

QUESTIONS?

All the questions about the building/installation process are to be directed
to the mailing list at ejboss@list.working-dogs.com, where we'll try to answer
any questions you have.

Thanks,
the jBoss team
