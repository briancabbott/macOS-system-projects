<LI><A NAME="WhatsNew"><strong>Q:</strong> What is new in JCE 1.2.1 compared to 
JCE 1.2?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> The primary difference between JCE 1.2 and JCE 1.2.1 is that JCE 1.2.1 is exportable outside the U.S. and Canada, due to
mechanisms it implements to ensure that only qualified 
providers can be plugged into the framework.
Qualified providers include those approved for export and
those certified for domestic use only. Qualified providers are
signed by a trusted entity. 

<P> JCE 1.2.1 providers may also be exportable.
Please refer to
<A HREF="doc/guide/HowToImplAProvider.html">How to Implement a Provider for 
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Cryptography Extension 1.2.1</A>
for more information.

<P> The JCE 1.2.1 software from Sun Microsystems now has a single
distribution for both domestic and global users. The bundled 
jurisdiction policy files contain no restrictions on 
cryptographic strengths.

<p>

<LI><A NAME="Archive"><strong>Q:</strong> Is there an archive of 
JCE mailing lists?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> There is no JCE-specific mailing list. 
However, the <a
href="mailto:java-security@sun.com">java-security@sun.com</a> alias
provides a feedback mechanism for the security components of the
Standard Edition Java Platform, including the JCE optional package.

<p>All emails sent to that alias are archived at:

<a href="http://archives.java.sun.com/archives/java-security.html">http://archives.java.sun.com/archives/java-security.html</a>.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="License"><strong>Q:</strong> What are the licensing terms for JCE 1.2.1?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> Sun's release of JCE 1.2.1 is a non-commercial 
reference implementation.
The release may be used royalty-free 
as part of commercial applications. See the <A 
href="jce121_license.txt">software 
license</A> for more information.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="GlobalAccess"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I access the JCE 1.2.1 
software from outside the U.S. or Canada?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> Yes. JCE 1.2.1 is exportable, meaning that it 
can be downloaded from most countries.  The exportability is the major new 
feature in JCE 1.2.1.
However, the following countries may not receive <STRONG> ANY </STRONG> 
US-developed encryption items, including JCE 1.2.1: Afghanistan, Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Serbia/Montenegro (Yugoslavia), 
Sudan, Syria and parties listed on the Denied and Restricted Parties List.
<p>


<LI><A NAME="FewerRestrictions"><strong>Q:</strong> I heard that the US 
Government has relaxed the export restrictions on encryption products. 
How does this affect JCE 1.2 and JCE 1.2.1?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> There has been some relaxation in the
export requirements for encryption products. 
Go to <a href="http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/regs_1_00.html"> http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/regs_1_00.html</a> for a 
complete 33-page report on current export requirements. 
Note also that a vendor's product status is dependent on the type of application they have with the government and at what point
the product was in in the government's application process when
the new regulations passed. Contrary to some articles in the press, export of 
encryption items is still a complicated, multi-dimensional issue.

<P> JCE 1.2 is still not exportable, because 
export control restrictions by the U.S. Department of Commerce prohibit
frameworks for encryption services from being exported unless appropriate
mechanisms have been implemented to ensure that only qualified providers can
be plugged into the framework. JCE 1.2 does not implement such mechanisms,
but JCE 1.2.1 does.
This makes JCE 1.2.1 exportable worldwide (except to the embargoed
countries listed in the previous answer and those on the 
Denied and Restricted Parties List).

<P> JCE 1.2.1 also includes an ability to enforce restrictions regarding the
cryptographic algorithms and maximum cryptographic strengths available to
applets/applications in different jurisdiction contexts (locations). 
The cryptographic restrictions are specified in "jurisdiction policy files"
that are downloaded with JCE 1.2.1. Since the US government has relaxed
export restrictions on cryptographic strengths, the JCE 1.2.1 software
from Sun Microsystems now has a single distribution for both domestic and 
global users. The bundled jurisdiction policy files contain no restrictions 
on cryptographic strengths. This is appropriate for most countries. 
Other framework vendors could create download bundles that include 
jurisdiction policy files that specify cryptographic restrictions 
appropriate for countries whose governments mandate restrictions.
Users in those countries could download an appropriate bundle, 
and the JCE framework will enforce the specified restrictions.

<p>

<LI><A NAME="SCSL"><strong>Q:</strong>  Will the source code to JCE 1.2.1 be made available through the Sun Community Source License program?</A><BR>

        <strong>A:</strong> Due to current government regulations, at this time,
Sun will not be able to make the source code available.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="BundleExport"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I bundle JCE 1.2.1 with 
my product and export it?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> Since JCE 1.2.1 has been granted "retail" status,
a product which bundles JCE 1.2.1 may be globally distributable.
Consult your export control counsel to verify how the export
regulations apply to your product.
<p>


<LI><A NAME="WorkW11x"><strong>Q:</strong> Does JCE 1.2.1 work with JDK 1.1.x?
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> No. JCE 1.2.1 is an optional package 
(formerly known as an "extension") to the Java 2 Platform.
JCE 1.2.1 supplements the cryptographic services defined in the
Java 2 SDK (J2SDK), Standard Edition, v 1.2.1 (formerly known as JDK 1.2.1).
It does not work with any previous releases.

<p>Furthermore, Java Software does not provide <i>any</i> version of 
JCE that works with any JDK 1.1.x release.
<p>


<LI><A NAME="Java"><strong>Q:</strong>
	Is JCE 1.2.1 written in the
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> programming language? 
<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, JCE 1.2.1 is written 
in the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> programming language. 

<p>


<LI><A NAME="CipherNotFound"><strong>Q:</strong> My cipher implementation 
is not found. I wrote my own
provider that subclasses <code>javax.crypto.CipherSpi</code> and
supplies its own cipher implementation. However, I cannot get an
instance of my cipher using <code>Cipher.getInstance()</code>.
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> In order to achieve exportability, only 
providers signed by a trusted
entity can be plugged into the JCE 1.2.1 framework. 
Please refer to
<A HREF="doc/guide/HowToImplAProvider.html">How to Implement a Provider for 
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Cryptography Extension 1.2.1</A>
for more information on how to ensure your provider will work with
JCE 1.2.1.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="DESNotFound"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I assume that JCE 1.2.1 and 
J2SDK have been configured properly if
<code>MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")</code> works?
The following line of code executes just fine:
<pre>
  MessageDigest dig = 
      MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
</pre>
However, this line:
<pre>
  KeyGenerator kgen = 
      KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");
</pre>
causes the following exception to be raised:
<pre>
  java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: 
    Algorithm DES not available
</pre>
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> J2SDK comes standard with a cryptographic service provider named
"SUN" (which supplies an implementation of the MD5 message digest
algorithm), and JCE 1.2.1 comes standard with a different provider named
"SunJCE" (which implements a session key generator
for DES). While the "SUN" provider is registered automatically, the
"SunJCE" provider needs to be registered explicitly.

<p>Please refer to the <a href="jce121_install.html">installation guide</a>
for directions on how to register the "SunJCE" provider. Once you have
registered the "SunJCE" provider, the above exception will disappear.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="CipherIOProb"><strong>Q:</strong> When I use <code>javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream</code> to encrypt data and write it to the underlying output stream, and <code>javax.crypto.CipherInputStream</code> to read the encrypted data from the underlying input stream and decrypt it, there seems to be a problem if the encapsulated Cipher object implements a block cipher w/ padding. CipherInputStream fails to recover the original data written using CipherOutputStream.
<br>
	<strong>A:</strong> Make sure that you call the <code>CipherOutputStream</code>'s
<code>close</code> method when you are done writing data to the
underlying output stream. This will cause any bytes buffered by the
encapsulated Cipher object to be padded and written out.

<p>Only when you call <code>CipherOutputStream.close()</code> will the encryption
operation be finalized, i.e., will <code>Cipher.doFinal()</code> be
called (on the encapsulated cipher).
