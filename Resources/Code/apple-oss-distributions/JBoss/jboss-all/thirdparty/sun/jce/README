Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for downloading the Java(TM) Cryptography Extension (JCE) 
1.2.1.

JCE 1.2.1 supplements the Java 2 platform, and requires
that you have it installed.

JCE 1.2.1 is written entirely in the Java(TM) programming language.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding The Export Issues
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
JCE 1.2.1 has been through the U.S. export review process. 
The JCE 1.2.1 framework, along with the SunJCE provider that comes
standard with it, is exportable.

JCE 1.2.1 introduces an architecture which allows flexible 
cryptographic strength to be configured via jurisdiction policy files 
that are downloaded along with the JCE 1.2.1 software. The JCE 1.2.1 
software from Sun Microsystems has a single distribution for both 
domestic and global users. The bundled jurisdiction policy files 
contain no restrictions on cryptographic strengths. This is appropriate
for most countries. Other framework vendors could create download 
bundles that include jurisdiction policy files that specify 
cryptographic restrictions appropriate for countries whose governments
mandate restrictions. Users in those countries could download an 
appropriate bundle, and the JCE framework will enforce the specified 
restrictions.

Since JCE 1.2.1 has been granted "retail" status,
a product which bundles JCE 1.2.1 may be globally distributable.
You are advised to consult your export control counsel or
attorney to determine the exact requirements.
