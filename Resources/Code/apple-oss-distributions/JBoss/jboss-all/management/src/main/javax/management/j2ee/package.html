      <p><em>JSR-77 Specification</em>.

      <h2>Package Specification</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>
            The JSR-77 implementations is composed of two different sets of
            interfaces.
            <ol>
               <li>
                  Interfaces showing the JSR-77 model implemented by interfaces.
                  There are (at least for the client) no real implementation. The
                  client will work on the JSR-77 server like a JMX client does. The
                  difference is that there are only basic data types attributes (int,
                  float etc. as well as Strings), JMX ObjectNames which refer to
                  another JSR-77 instance) and statistics interfaces.
                  Also note that J2EEManagementEvents are sent as JMX Notifications.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Statistics interfaces which must be implemented by a JSR-77 vendor
                  because they are sent to the client and the client has to understand
                  them. Statistics are all classes named <b>*Stats</b> or <b>*Statistic</b>.
                  Note that Stats contains statistic information wrapped into Statistics
                  interfaces. Therefore Statistic interfaces represent a statistic value
                  (Count, Boundary etc.) whereas Stats contains Statistics intefaces to
                  show the statistic information for a specific J2EE components.
