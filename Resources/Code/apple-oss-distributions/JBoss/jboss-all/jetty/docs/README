JBoss-Jetty.
-----------

This is a module that integrates intra-vm JBoss CVS with Jetty3 CVS
(jetty.mortbay.com).

Jetty is then able to provide JBoss with the services of Servlet
Container and HTTP Server.

To INSTALL : (I'm assuming Un*x - Windows later..)

cd contrib/jetty/src/build
(set up JBOSS_HOME and JETTY_HOME)
sh ./build.sh install (installs jetty-service.jar in jboss tree)
sh ./build.sh client  (builds contrib/jetty/tomcat-test.ear)

Uncomment the necessary Jetty stuff in
$JBOSS_HOME/conf/default/jboss.conf and jboss.jcml - ensuring that you
set up a ClassPathExtension pointing to Jetty's lib directory,
org.jboss.deployment.J2eeDeployer's WarDeployerName Arg is changed to
: :service=Jetty and that you set the Attribute url for JettyService
as suggested in the comment.

To TEST :

Follow the instructions in contrib/tomcat to deploy and run the
tomcat-test.ear (WebApp and EJBs).

To further test Jetty try hitting <jboss-host>:8080/ (If you haven't
altered the port Jetty is configured to run on). This will run the
Jetty web-application, giving you access to the Jetty demo test-suite.

PROBLEMS :

Jetty questions should be directed to jetty-discuss@egroups.com
JBoss questions should be directed to jboss-user@list.working-dogs.com
I shall be happy to answer questions about the integration.


Enjoy.
