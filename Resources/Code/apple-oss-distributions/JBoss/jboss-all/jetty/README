This plugin integrates Jetty with JBoss.

Jetty is wrapped up as a JettyService MBean (deployed in
jetty-plugin.sar) and fulfils the role of WebContainer.

Non WebContainer specific functionality is inherited from
/server/src/main/org/jboss/web/AbstractWebContainer.java, where it can
be shared by other WebContainer integrations.

The integration basically maps Jetty's lifecycle to that of a JBoss
Service, exposes Jetty's webapp deployment functionality to
AbstractWebContainer, and integrates the following functionality:

log:
----

We supply a Jetty Logger which maps to the JBoss logging scheme

security:
---------

We supply a Jetty UserRealm which maps a Jetty SimplePrincipal onto a
JBoss UserPrincipal and provides the necessary authentication and
authorisation implementation. (JAAS is supported).

session:
--------

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT - We extend Jetty's HttpSession management to
support distributable sessions by reusing infrastructure available
from JBoss (JBossHA, EJBs etc). Various strategies are configurable.

xml:
----

We provide local resolution for a number of webapp descriptors and are
responsible for parsing said descriptors and sharing results with
AbstractWebContainer, whence it may set up e.g. JNDI bindings
(java:/comp/env) etc.
