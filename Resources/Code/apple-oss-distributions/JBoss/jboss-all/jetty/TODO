greg's 1.4 code
investigate 'too many open files' and Jasper
fix CMR and Cluster impls
partition JGStore ?
hook up XAManager
lose stopGracefully stuff from subclass
FileStore session impl ?
Figure out why JGStore hangs
remove debug from JGStore
move Validation back into EJBs
EJB inheritance ?
what about Gregs other jars ?
use Array instead of ArrayList for interceptor stack ?
write a Container.class
give reason for extraTime - explain constraints
fix contributors page
try in 3.0.1/3.1
fix HttpSessionActualMaxInactiveInterval,LocalHttpSessionScavengePeriod etc... names...
virtual hosts
multiple Jetty instances
SystemProps - tmp.dir & jetty.port etc...



distributable sessions :
	do not cache containers - should be stateless
	go to DB on every find
	do invalid() test in remote object
	need a method - getAttributeBindingEventListeners ?
	InvariantInterceptor - we know id, context & creationTime are invariant

Interceptors need to be stateless ?
Is a ThreadLocal stateless ?
MigrationInterceptor tricky
PushPopInterceptor could be a dynamic proxy
StateInterceptor store Session - not allowed
SynchronizationInterceptor will be tricky
ThrottleInterceptor also tricky

Ask Greg how he configures dynamically built objects - through defaults or properties or...

only return Listeners from get/set/rem attribute... - and only then if
the BindingInterceptor is installed...


maintain sessions between bounces

maintain compiled JSP classes between bounces

multiple virtual host support

soft stop
lots of javadoc
copyrights...
copy org.mortbay.j2ee.ejb.jar --> jbossweb-ejbs.jar - but where ?
check ClusteredStore
doc


Get Jetty to use JBoss' tmpdir instead of /tmp...


could I do a better job of logging integration if I actually replaced
the mortbay log class rather than bridged from it ?

investigate JSR77 & 88 and JBoss support for them.

separation of web & ejb tiers

more than one Jetty instance running in the same JBoss - e.g. serving
multiple virtual hosts, ports etc...

Client Certificate based authentication
Digest based authentication
sort out 'run-as'.

Should javax.servlet.jar go into jboss-j2ee.jar?

More of Jetty internals need to be exposed as MBeans

Repackage Jetty legacy servlets into webapp (CGI)?

JBoss/Jetty sould have a default app - either Jetty demo - or petstore
(copyright problems??) (or both, we could hand petstore and jboss
website off Jetty Demo).

Configuration needs to be available at different levels e.g. global
(jboss-service.xml), webapp (jetty-web.xml)

If you deploy some webapps and bounce Jetty, they are unloaded. When
Jetty comes back up we are in an inconsistant state. The deployer
thinks the apps are deployed - Jetty does not. This should be fixed by
David Jenks dependency stuff.

roles and threads - problem in 2.* ??? - see forums...

Running from a packed war - JSPs still don't work because only
WEB-INF/lib/* get's copied out...

Investigate other major J2EE webapps (struts, velocity, cocoon, web
services etc) and ensure that they run OK on JBoss/Jetty. Testsuite
should run through them.

Separation of Web/Presentation from Business Logic tier - by RemoteMBeanProxy???
MultiMBeanProxy & RemoteMBeanProxy

FOE Deployer - may need to switch Jetty into an emulation mode Bill
says BEA webcontainer non-std - (flush=true, forward/redirect
anytime/anywhere) and Jetty did not handle relative paths well -
december?

Distributed HttpSessions - order of initialisation...

Clustered HttpSession distribution policies need refactoring so that
they may be combined - i.e.  every group of requests OR every 10
seconds In case we get a request storm and groups of requests
intersect.

In devel target - jetty-ejb.jar should live inside jetty-plugin.sar -

Distributed HttpSession - We need a ?Cactus-based? session aware
test-suite - JG?

Why does my CoarseHttpSession stuff not work anymore? - JG

CoarseHttpSession implementation has no GC - it will need it

Share code between StatefulSession & HttpSession

----------------------------------------
AbstractWebContainer
----------------------------------------

Is JBoss unpacking wars and then getting Jetty to repeat the effort?

DDs are parsed multiple times, and into DOM, SAX or JAXB might be
faster - probably ties in with JSR88.

Descriptors are parsed into DOMs - SAX would be faster (do we really
need DOM) - what about JAXB?

Both Jetty and the integration code parse web.xml - waste of time

Refactor/Lose TimeOutManager

Persistant/Distributed Sessions - various implementations - JG

AbstractWebContainer is already parsing jboss-web.xml, so we should
not need to parse it as well.
