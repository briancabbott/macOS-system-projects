    <p><em>The default Transaction Manager implementation</em>.


    <h2>Package Specification</h2>
    <ul>

The classes in this package belong may be grouped into two:
<ul>
  <li><em>Application server interface</em>. This group consists of the
     two classes {@link: TransactionPropagationContextFactory} and
     {@link: TransactionPropagationContextImporter}. Together these two
     classes form the JBoss-specific Communication Resource Manager (CRM).
  </li>
  <li><em>The default Transaction Service</em>. This is the rest of the
     classes in this package. It is a very fast JTA implementation with
     two drawbacks:
     <ul>
       <li>
         It has no transactional logging or recovery after server crashes.
       </li>
       <li>
         Transactions cannot be propagated from one server VM to another.
         But the thin-client UserTransaction service works fine, in case
         you just want to control transactions on a single server from your
         stand-alone clients.
       </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
       
</ul>
    </ul>
      
    <h2>The JBoss-specific Communication Resource Manager</h2>
    <p>A CRM is responsible for converting local transactions from/to a
    form that can be serialized so it can be passed over the wire to
    another Java VM.</p>
    <p>The JTA specification does not define the CRM, so we have implemented
    our own.</p>
    <p>The J2EE specification suggests that the CRM used is the OTS
    CosTSPortability CRM, but that depends heavily on CORBA, and JBoss is
    not dependent on any particular object request broker technology, so
    we do not use that.</p>
    <p>The advantage of using our own CRM implementation instead of
    CosTSPortablilty is twofold:
    <ul>
      <li>
        JBoss does not depend on CORBA, and will run just fine without it.
      </li>
      <li>
        JBoss is able to use JTA implementations that are completely
        incompatible with OTS.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adapting an existing JTA implementation for JBoss</h2>
    <p>In JBoss everything is a MBean. Implementing your JTA implementation
    as an MBean makes it simpler to manage it in a standardized way.</p>
    Since your JTA implementation is a service you probably want to make
    your MBean implemementation extend from
    <code>org.jboss.system.ServiceMBeanSupport</code>.</p>
    When running in the server, your MBean should publish three objects
    in JNDI:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>java:/TransactionManager</em>
        When this JNDI name is looked up, it should return an object instance
        that implements <code>javax.transaction.TransactionManager</code>.
        This is the standard JTA transaction manager that the JBoss server
        uses to control transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>java:/TransactionPropagationContextImporter</em>
        When this JNDI name is looked up, it should return an object instance
        that implements
        <code>org.jboss.tm.TransactionPropagationContextImporter</code>.
        This is used by the JBoss communication layers to convert the wire
        representation of a transaction to a
        <code>javax.transaction.Transaction</code> instance that can be used
        locally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>java:/TransactionPropagationContextFactory</em>
        When this JNDI name is looked up, it should return an object instance
        that implements
        <code>org.jboss.tm.TransactionPropagationContextFactory</code>.
        This is used by the JBoss communication layers to convert the wire
        representation of a <code>javax.transaction.Transaction</code>
        instance to a form that can be passed over the wire to another JBoss
        server.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>See the implementation of
    <code>org.jboss.tm.TransactionManagerService</code> for an example of
    such a MBean. Please note that the three names your MBean should publish
    in JNDI need not refer to the same object instance as the
    <code>TransactionManagerService</code> does.</p>

    <p>Please note that the transaction propagation context (TPC) used by
    the CRM interfaces <code>TransactionPropagationContextImporter</code>
    and <code>TransactionPropagationContextFactory</code> is of type
    <code>java.lang.Object</code>. This allows for the widest range of
    possible TPC implementations. For your TPC to work with the JBoss
    JRMP transport, it should be Java-serializable at runtime.</p>
