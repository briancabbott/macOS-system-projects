<!--
The cache-between-transactions element tells the EJB container whether
to cache the persistent data of an entity bean across (between)
transactions.

When a value of 'true' is specified caching between transactions is
enabled and long term caching of data is performed.  If a value of
'false' is specified, (the default) short term caching is done, which
means that data is only cached during an individual transaction.  A
value of 'true' is only allowed if the concurrency-strategy for a bean
is either Exclusive, ReadOnly, or Optimistic.

A ReadOnly bean simply ignores the value of the
cache-between-transactions element since long term caching of readonly
data is always performed.

When long term caching is enabled for Exclusive concurrency, the EJB
container must have exclusive update access to the underlying data,
i.e. the data must not be updated by another application outside of
the EJB container.  If an Exclusive bean is deployed in a cluster, long
term caching is disabled automatically because any node in the cluster
may update the data, making long term caching impossible.  (Note: In
releases prior to WLS 7.0, this feature was controlled using the
db-is-shared element.)

When long term caching is enabled for Optimistic concurrency, the EJB
container reuses cached values from previous transactions, but ensures
that updates are transactionally consistent by checking for optimistic
conflicts at the end of the transaction.  In addition, notifications
for updates of optimistic data are broadcast to other cluster members
to help avoid optimistic conflicts.

Used in: entity-cache, entity-cache-ref

Default value: false

<!--
The concurrency-strategy specifies how the container should manage concurrent 
access to an entity bean.

The concurrent-strategy can be one of the following values:
  - "Exclusive":  The exclusive locking scheme used in WebLogic 
                  Server versions 3.1 through 5.1
  - "Database":   A scheme where a separate Entity Bean instance is 
                  allocated for each transaction and the locking and
                  caching is handled by the database.
  - "ReadOnly" :  For read-only entity beans

  - "Optimistic" : When using optimistic concurrency, no locks are
                   held in the EJB container or database during a
                   transaction.  The EJB container verifies that none
                   of the data that was updated by a transaction has
                   changed before committing the transaction.  If any
                   updated data has been changed, the transaction is
                   rolled back.

Each Message-Driven EJB listens on an associated JMS destination.  If
the JMS destination is located on another WebLogic Server instance or
a foreign JMS provider, it is possible that the JMS destination will
become unreachable.  In this case, the EJB container automatically
attempts to reconnect to the JMS Server.  Once the JMS Server is up
again, the Message-Driven EJB can again receive JMS messages.

The jms-polling-interval-seconds determines the number of seconds
between each attempt to reconnect to the JMS destination.

Default value: 10 seconds

The JMS specification allows JMS consumers to specify an associated
id.  This id is necessary for durable subscriptions to
JMS topics.

A Message-Driven EJB with a durable subscription needs an associated
client id.  If a separate connection factory is used, the
client id can be set on the connection factory.  In this case,
the Message-Driven EJB uses this client id.

If the associated connection factory does not have a client id
(or you are using the default connection factory), the Message-Driven
EJB uses the jms-client-id value as its client id.

Default:

  The default client identifier is the ejb-name for this EJB.

The estimated-bean-size element is used to specify the estimated
average size of the instances of an entity bean in bytes.  This is the
average number of bytes of memory that is consumed by each instance.

The estimated-bean-size is used when the size of the application level
cache that is being used to cache the beans is also specified in terms
of bytes or megabytes.  The estimated-bean-size limits the maximum
number of instances that may exist in the cache at any one time.

Although an application deployer/developer probably does not know the
exact number of bytes that will be consumed by the instances of an
entity bean, specifying a size allows him/her to give some relative
weight to the beans that are sharing a cache.  For example, suppose
that beans A and B share a cache 'AB-cache' that has a size of 1000
bytes.  And suppose that the size of A is 10 and that the size of B is
20 bytes.  Then the cache can hold at most 100 instances of A or 50
instances of B at any one time (100*10 = 50*20 = 1000).  If 100
instances of A are cached, this implies that 0 instances of B are
cached.

the EJB.  To enable clustering for your EJB, see the entity-clustering,
