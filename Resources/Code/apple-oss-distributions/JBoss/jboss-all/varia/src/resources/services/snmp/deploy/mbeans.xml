  This file is used to configure the JMX listening subscriptions, 
  i.e. which JMX Notifications to intercept from which MBeans.
  
  The SnmpAgentService MBean will then subscribe to receive those
  notifications directly from the corresponding MBeans by setting an
  appropriate filter with each MBean. The intercepted JMX notifications
  will be eventually mapped onto SNMP traps.
  
  Each monitored object is identified by its full ObjectName, i.e.
  the name under which it is registered at the MBeanServer. It is assumed
  that monitored objects are NotificationBroadcasters.
  
  JMX notifications, in turn, are of a certain type. The type is a
  string expressed in a dot notation similar to Java properties.
  An example of a notification type is network.alarm.router.
  
  For each monitored MBean, one or more notification types may be
  monitored. Each specified type will be used to setup a regular expression
  pattern (see java.util.regexp.Pattern), so an entry in this
  configuration file may be used to match more than one actual
  notification types emitted by the monitored MBeans.
