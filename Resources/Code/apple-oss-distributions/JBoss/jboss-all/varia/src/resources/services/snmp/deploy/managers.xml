  This file is used to configure the SNMP managers to which the generated
  SNMP traps should be forwarded.
  
  Each entry must specify:
    - the manager's address (IP address or host name)
    - the listening port
    - the local binding port (optional)
    - the SNMP version to use (1 or 2)
    
  More than one managers may be specified.
  
  Note that traps are sent inside independent UDP packets so there is a
  possibility to be re-ordered or completely lost. Also, even if the 
  forwarding IP address does not exist or nobody is listening on that
  particular port, the trap will still be sent (however, nobody will
  receive it); this is normal behaviour.

    A default test manager to forward traps. It is controlled by the
    "jboss.jmx:name=SnmpAgent,service=trapd,type=logger" MBean that
    simply outputs received traps as log4j INFO messages
