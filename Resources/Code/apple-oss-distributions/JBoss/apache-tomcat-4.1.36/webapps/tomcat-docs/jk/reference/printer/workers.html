<br>
<p>
A <b>Tomcat worker</b> is a Tomcat instance that is waiting to execute servlets or any other content
on behalf of some web server. For example, we can have a web server such as
Apache forwarding servlet requests to a Tomcat process (the worker) running behind it.
</p>
<p>
The scenario described above is a very simple one;
in fact one can configure multiple Tomcat workers to serve servlets on
behalf of a certain web server.
The reasons for such configuration can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We want different contexts to be served by different Tomcat workers to provide a
development environment where all the developers share the same web server but
own a Tomcat worker of their own.
</li>
<li>
We want different virtual hosts served by different Tomcat processes to provide a
clear separation between sites belonging to different companies.
</li>
<li>
We want to provide load balancing, meaning run multiple Tomcat workers each on a
machine of its own and distribute the requests between them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are probably more reasons for having multiple workers but I guess that this list is enough...
Tomcat workers are defined in a properties file dubbed <b>workers.properties</b> and this tutorial
explains how to work with it.

finish having many unused ajp13 threads on the Tomcat side.

<p>Load balancer is a virtual worker that does not really communicate with Tomcat workers.
Instead it is responsible for the management of several "real" workers.
The worker is supposed to be a load balancer if it's worker type is <b>lb</b>.
See worker's <b>type</b> directive. The workers that
are member of load balancer must not appear in the <b>worker.list</b> directive.
</p>
<p>Loadbalancer directives defines the parameters needed to create a workers that are
connecting to a remote cluster of backend Tomcat servers. Each cluster node has to
have a worker defined.
</p>
<p>
Load balancer management includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Instantiating the workers in the web server.
</li>
<li>
Using the worker's load-balancing factor, perform weighed-round-robin load balancing where
high lbfactor means stronger machine (that is going to handle more requests)
</li>

</li>
<li>
Identifying failed Tomcat workers, suspending requests to them and instead fall-backing on
other workers managed by the lb worker.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overall result is that workers managed by the same lb worker are load-balanced

Specifies what method load balancer is using for electing the best worker.
Please note, that session stickyness and perfect load balancing are
conflicting targets, especially when the number
of sessions is small, or the usage of sessions is extremely varying
For huge numbers of sessions this usually is not a problem.
<p>
Some methods note, that they aggregate in a sliding time window. They add up
accesses, and on each run of the global maintain method, the load counters
get divided by 2. Usually this happens once a minute, depending on the
setting of worker.maintain. The value of the load counters can be inspected
using the status worker.
</p>
<p>
If method is set to <b>R[equest]</b> the balancer will use number of requests
to find the best worker. Accesses will be distributed according to the
lbfactor in a sliding time window. This is the default value and should be
working well for most applications.
</p>
<p>
If method is set to <b>S[ession]</b> the balancer will use number of sessions
to find the best worker. Accesses will be distributed according to the
lbfactor in a sliding time window. Because the balancer does not keep any state,
it actually does not know the number of sessions. Instead it counts each request
without a session cookie or URL encoding as a new session. This method will neither
know, when a session is being invalidated, nor will it correct its load numbers
according to session timeouts or worker failover. This method should be used,
if sessions are your limiting resource, e.g. when you only have limited memory
and your sessions need a lot of memory.
</p>
<p>
If set to <b>T[raffic]</b> the balancer will use
the network traffic between JK and Tomcat to find the best worker.
Accesses will be distributed according to the lbfactor in a sliding time window.
This method should be used, if network to and from the backends is your
limiting resource.
</p>
<p>
If set to <b>B[usyness]</b> the balancer will
pick the worker with the lowest current load, based on how many requests the
worker is currently serving. This number is divided by the workers lbfactor,
and the lowest value (least busy) worker is picked. This method is especially
interesting, if your request take a long time to process, like for a download
application.

For every load balancer worker, the status worker shows a summary
of the state of its members. There are three such states,
"good", "bad" and "degraded".
<p>
These states are determined depending on the activation of the members
(active, disabled, stopped) and their runtime state
(ok, n/a, busy, recovering, probing, forced recovery, error).
By default, members are assumed to be "good", if their activation
is "active" and their runtime state is not "error".
</p>
<p>
You can change this mapping, by assigning a list of values to the
attribute "good". Each value gives a possible match for the members,
and one match suffices. Each value is either a single character, or two
characters combined with a dot ".". The single characters are the
first characters in the words "active", "disabled", "stopped",
"ok", "na", "busy", "recovering", "error". The additional states "probing"
and "forced recovery" are always rated equivalent to "recovering".
If a value consists only
of a single character, then all members with this activation or runtime
state will be assumed good. A combination of an activation and a runtime
state concatenated with a dot "." does only apply to a member, that has
exactly this activation and state.
</p>
<p>
Members of a load balancer will first be matched against the state "bad",
if they don't match, the state "good" will be tried, and if they
still don't match, their state will be "degraded".

group. By default (value zero) the webserver will wait forever which could be an issue for you.
The parameter is the number of milliseconds to wait for reply, so adjust it carefully if you
have long running servlets.
<p>
This features has been added in <b>jk 1.2.6</b> to avoid problem with hung tomcat's and works on all
servlet engines supporting ajp13.

Only used for load balancer workers.
<p>
The recover time is the time in seconds the load balancer will not try
to use a worker, after it went into error state. Only after this time has passed,
a worker in error state will be marked as in recovering, so that it will be
tried for new requests.
</p>
<p>
This interval is not checked every time a request is being processed.
Instead it is being checked during global maintenance. The time between two
runs of global maintenance is controlled by worker.maintain.
</p>
<p>
Do not set recover_time to a very short time unless you understand the implications.
Every recovery attempt for a worker in error is done by a real request!

Recovery options property told webserver how to handle recovery when
it detect that tomcat failed.
By default, webserver will forward the request to another tomcat in LB mode
(or to another ajp thread in ajp13 mode).
values are : 0 (full recovery), 1 (don't recover if tomcat failed after getting the request),
2 (don't recover if tomcat failed after sending the headers to client), 3 (don't recover if tomcat failed
getting the request or after sending the headers to client).

<p>If the value 4 is added to the recovery options, the connection
between the webserver and tomcat will be closed if the client connection
to the webserver is terminated during the request/response cycle. This allows
to inform the servlet engine about broken client connections during lengthy operations.

Cachesize defines the number of connections made to the AJP backend that
are maintained as a connection pool.
It will limit the number of those connection that each web server child
process can make.
<p>
Cachesize property is used only for multi threaded 
web servers such as Apache 2.0 (worker), IIS and Netscape. The cachesize property
should reflect the number of threads per child process. JK will discover
the number of threads per child process on Apache 2 web server with worker-mpm and set
its default value to match the ThreadsPerChild Apache directive. For IIS the default
value is 10. For other web servers than Apache or IIS this value has to be set manually.

Cache timeout property should be used with <b>cachesize</b> to specify how to time JK should keep
an open socket in cache before closing it. This property should be used to reduce the number of threads 
on the Tomcat web server.
<p> 
Each child could open an ajp13 connection if it have to forward a request to Tomcat, creating
a new ajp13 thread on Tomcat side.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that after an ajp13 connection is created, the child won't drop it
until killed. And since the webserver will keep its childs/threads running
to handle high-load, even it the child/thread handle only static contents, you could
finish having many unused ajp13 threads on the Tomcat side.

The number of seconds that told webserver to cut an ajp13 connection after some time of 
inactivity. When choosing an endpoint for a request and the assigned socket is open, it will be
closed if it was not used for the configured time.
It's a good way to ensure that there won't too old threads living on Tomcat side, 
with the extra cost you need to reopen the socket next time a request be forwarded.
This property is very similar to <b>cache_timeout</b> but works also in non-cache mode.
If set to value zero (default) no recycle will took place.
