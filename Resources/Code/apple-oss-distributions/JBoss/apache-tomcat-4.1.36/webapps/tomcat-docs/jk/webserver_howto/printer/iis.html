This document explains how to set up IIS to cooperate with Tomcat. 
</p>

<p>
Normally IIS can not execute Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs), 
configuring IIS to use the JK ISAPI redirector plugin will let IIS send servlet and 
JSP requests to Tomcat (and this way, serve them to clients).
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that you also read the <a href="workers.html">Workers HowTo</a> document
to learn how to setup the working entities between your web server and Tomcat Engines.

The IIS-Tomcat redirector is an IIS plugin (filter + extension), IIS load the redirector plugin and calls its 
filter function for each in-coming request.
</li>
<li>
The filter then tests the request URL against a list of URI-paths held inside uriworkermap.properties, 
If the current request matches one of the entries in the list of URI-paths, 
the filter transfer the request to the extension.
</li>
<li>
The extension collects the request parameters and forwards them to the appropriate worker using the defined
protocol like <b>ajp13</b>.

<li>
The extension collects the response from the worker and returns it to the browser.

<p>
A pre-built version of the ISAPI redirector server plugin, isapi_redirect.dll, is available under 
the win32/i386 directory of tomcat-connectors distribution. 
For those using Netscape as your browser, try downloading a zip version of the file, if available. 
There can be problems using Netscape to download DLL files.

You can also build a copy locally from the source present in tomcat-connectors distribution.

The Tomcat redirector requires three entities:

<ul>
<li>
<b>isapi_redirect.dll</b> - The IIS server plugin, either obtain a pre-built DLL or build it yourself (see the build section).
</li>
<li>
<b><a href="../../reference/workers.html">workers.properties</a></b> - A file that describes the host(s) and port(s) used by the workers (Tomcat processes). 
A sample workers.properties can be found under the conf directory.
</li>
<li>
<b><a href="../../reference/uriworkermap.html">uriworkermap.properties</a></b> - A file that maps URL-Path patterns to workers. 
A sample uriworkermap.properties can be found under the conf directory as well.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The installation includes the following parts:

<ul>
<li>
Configuring the ISAPI redirector with a default /examples context and checking that you can serve servlets with IIS.
</li>
<li>
Adding more contexts to the configuration.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In this document I will assume that isapi_redirect.dll is placed in 
<b>c:\tomcat\bin\win32\i386\isapi_redirect.dll</b> and 
that you created the properties files are in <b>c:\tomcat\conf</b>.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
In the registry, create a new registry key named
<b>"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Jakarta Isapi Redirector\1.0"</b>
</li>
<li>
Add a string value with the name <b>extension_uri</b> and a value of <b>/jakarta/isapi_redirect.dll</b>
</li>
<li>
Add a string value with the name <b>log_file</b> and a value pointing to where you want your 
log file to be (for example <b>c:\tomcat\logs\isapi.log</b>).
</li>
<li>
Add a string value with the name <b>log_level</b> and a value for your log level 
(can be debug, info, error or emerg).
</li>
<li>
Add a string value with the name <b>worker_file</b> and a value which is the full path 
to your workers.properties file (for example <b>c:\tomcat\conf\workers.properties</b>)
</li>
<li>
Add a string value with the name <b>worker_mount_file</b> and a value which is the full path 
to your uriworkermap.properties file (for example <b>c:\tomcat\conf\uriworkermap.properties</b>)
</li>
<li>
Using the IIS management console, add a new virtual directory to your IIS/PWS web site.
The name of the virtual directory must be jakarta. 
Its physical path should be the directory where you placed isapi_redirect.dll 
(in our example it is c:\tomcat\bin\win32\i386). 
While creating this new virtual directory assign it with execute access.
</li>
<li>
Using the IIS management console, add isapi_redirect.dll as a filter in your IIS/PWS web site. 
The name of the filter should reflect its task (I use the name tomcat), 
its executable must be our c:\tomcat\bin\win32\i386\isapi_redirect.dll. 
For PWS, you'll need to use regedit and add/edit the <b>"Filter DLLs"</b> key under 
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters</b>. 
This key contains a "," separated list of dlls ( full paths ) - 
you need to insert the full path to isapi_redirect.dll.
</li>
<li>
Restart IIS (stop + start the IIS service), make sure that the tomcat filter is marked with a green up-pointing arrow.
Under Win98 you may need to <b>cd WINDOWS\SYSTEM\inetsrv</b> and type PWS /stop 
( the DLL and log files are locked - even if you click the stop button, 
PWS will still keep the DLLs in memory. ). Type pws to start it again.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
That's all, you should now start Tomcat and ask IIS to serve you the /examples context. 
Try <a href="http://localhost/examples/jsp/index.html">http://localhost/examples/jsp/index.html</a> for example and 
execute some of the JSP examples. 
</p>
<p>
If this does not work successfully, refer to the Troubleshooting section below for help on correcting the problem.

<p>
The examples context is useful for verifying your installation, 
but you will also need to add your own contexts. Adding a new context requires two operations:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Adding the context to Tomcat (I am not going to talk about this).
</li>
<li>
Adding the context to the ISAPI redirector.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Adding a context to the ISAPI redirector is simple, all you need to do is to edit 
your uriworkermap.properties and to add a line that looks like:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre>
  /context/*=worker_name
</pre></div>

<p>
Workers and their name are defined in workers.properties, by default workers.properties comes 
with a single pre-configured worker named <b>"defworker"</b> so you can use it. 
As an example, if you want to add a context named "shop", the line that you should add to 
uriworkermap.properties will be:
</p>

<div class="example"><pre>
  /shop/*=defworker
</pre></div>

After saving uriworkermap.properties restart IIS and it will serve the new context.

<p>
A feature is present till Tomcat 3.2, where a uriworkermap.properties-auto is automatically 
written each time Tomcat is started. This file includes settings for each of the contexts that 
Tomcat will serve during its run. 
</p>
<p>
Each context has settings to have Tomcat handle servlet and JSP requests, 
but by default static content is left to be served by IIS. 
</p>
<p>
Each context also has a commented out setting to have Tomcat handle all requests to the context. 
You can rename this file (so it won't be overwritten the next time Tomcat is started) and 
uncomment this setting or make other customizations. 
</p>
<p>
You may also use this file as is in your worker_mount_file setting.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it is better to have IIS serve the static pages (html, gif, jpeg etc.) 
even if these files are part of a context served by Tomcat. 
</p>
<p>
For example, consider the html and gif files in the examples context, there is no need 
to serve them from the Tomcat process, IIS will suffice.
</p>

<p>
Making IIS serve static files that are part of the Tomcat contexts requires the following:
<ol>
<li>
Configuring IIS to know about the Tomcat contexts
</li>
<li>
Configuring the redirector to leave the static files for IIS
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Adding a Tomcat context to IIS requires the addition of a new IIS virtual directory that covers the Tomcat context. 
For example adding a /example IIS virtual directory that covers the c:\tomcat\webapps\examples directory.
</p>

<p>
Configuring the redirector is somewhat harder, you will need to specify the exact 
URL-Path pattern(s) that you want Tomcat to handle (usually only JSP files and servlets). 
This requires a change to the uriworkermap.properties : 

<div class="example"><pre>
  For the examples context it requires to replace the following line
  /examples/*=defworker
  with the following two lines
  /examples/*.jsp=defworker
  /examples/servlet/*=defworker
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
As you can see the second configuration is more explicit, it actually instruct the redirector 
to redirect only requests to resources under /examples/servlet/ and resources under /examples/ 
whose name ends with .jsp. 
This is similar to what is automically written to the uriworkermap.properties-auto file for each context.
</p>

<p>
You can even be more explicit and provide lines such as:

<div class="example"><pre>
  /example/servletname=defworker
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
that instructs the redirector to redirect request whose URL-Path equals /example/servletname 
to the worker named defworker.

<p>
Each servlet application (context) has a special directory named WEB-INF, 
this directory contains sensitive configurations data and Java classes and must be kept hidden from web users. 
Using the IIS management console it is possible to protect the WEB-INF directory from user access, 
this however requires the administrator to remember that. 
</p>
<p>
To avoid this need the redirector plugin automatically protects your WEB-INF directories by rejecting 
any request that contains WEB-INF in its URL-Path.

<p>
Sometimes you want to serve different contexts with different Tomcat processes 
(for example to spread the load among different machines). 
To achieve such goal you will need to define several workers and assign each context with its own worker.
</p>
<p>
Defining workers is done in workers.properties, this file includes two types of entries:
</p>

<p>
<div class="example"><pre>
  # An entry that lists all the workers defined
  worker.list=worker1, worker2
  # Entries that define the host and port associated with these workers
  worker.worker1.host=localhost
  worker.worker1.port=8009
  worker.worker1.type=ajp13
  worker.worker2.host=otherhost
  worker.worker2.port=8009
  worker.worker2.type=ajp13
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
The above example defined two workers, now we can use these workers to serve two different contexts 
each with its own worker: 
<div class="example"><pre>
  example uriworkermap.properties fragment
  /examples/*=worker1
  /webpages/*=worker2
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
As you can see the <b>examples</b> context is served by <b>worker1</b> while the 
<b>webpages</b> context is served by <b>worker2</b>.
</p>
