# NAME

Test::use::ok - Alternative to Test::More::use_ok

# SYNOPSIS

    use ok 'Some::Module';

# DESCRIPTION

According to the __Test::More__ documentation, it is recommended to run
`use_ok()` inside a `BEGIN` block, so functions are exported at
compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.

That is, instead of writing this:

    use_ok( 'Some::Module' );
    use_ok( 'Other::Module' );

One should write this:

    BEGIN { use_ok( 'Some::Module' ); }
    BEGIN { use_ok( 'Other::Module' ); }

However, people often either forget to add `BEGIN`, or mistakenly group
`use_ok` with other tests in a single `BEGIN` block, which can create subtle
differences in execution order.

With this module, simply change all `use_ok` in test scripts to `use ok`,
and they will be executed at `BEGIN` time.  The explicit space after `use`
makes it clear that this is a single compile-time action.
