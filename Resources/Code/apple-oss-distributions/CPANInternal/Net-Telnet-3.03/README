  What's In It For You
  --------------------

   .  You'd like to communicate with another host or device via a
      TELNET port and you'd like some specialized routines to help you
      login and do other interactive things.

   .  You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple way to
      make client connections to TCP services.

   .  You want to be able to specify your own time-out while
      connecting, reading, and writing.

   .  You're communicating with an interactive program at the other
      end of some socket or pipe and you want to wait for certain
      patterns to appear.


  Archive Location
  ----------------

    .  In the CPAN directory: modules/by-module/Net/

    .  To find a CPAN site near you see http://cpan.perl.org/SITES.html


  Prerequisites
  -------------

    .  Perl Version 5.002 or later

    .  A MS-Windows machine requires Perl version 5.003_07 or later

    .  No other modules are required that don't already come with a
       standard distribution of Perl.


  Description
  -----------

    Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port
    and do network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET
    protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are
    provided.  More sophisticated interactive features are provided
    because connecting to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating
    with a program designed for human interaction.  These interactive
    features include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for
    patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a
    shell.

    Here's an example that prints who's logged-on to the remote host
    sparky.  In addition to a username and password, you must also
    know the user's shell prompt, which for this example it's bash$

        use Net::Telnet ();
        $t = new Net::Telnet (Timeout => 10,
                              Prompt => '/bash\$ $/');
        $t->open("sparky");
        $t->login($username, $passwd);
        @lines = $t->cmd("who");
        print @lines;

    See the user documentation for more examples.  Also see the user
    documentation for the section "What To Know Before Using".

    Usage questions should be directed to the Usenet newsgroup
    comp.lang.perl.modules.

  Documentation
  -------------

    User documentation in POD format is contained within the module
    source (i.e. the .pm file).  Installing using "make install"
    places this documentation in a man page in the perl library under
    the directory "man/man3".

    To nicely format the documentation for printing, you may use
    "groff" to convert to postscript.  Groff is available under
    the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is installed on most
    Linux machines.

        pod2man Net/Telnet.pm | groff -man -Tps > Net::Telnet.ps


  Installation
  ------------

    To install, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
    distribution and do one of the following:

    a.  Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using the perl
        program into whose library you want to install and then run
        make three times:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    b.  To install into a private library, for example your home
        directory:

            perl Makefile.PL \
                 INSTALLSITELIB=$HOME/lib/perl \
                 INSTALLMAN3DIR=$HOME/lib/perl/man/man3
            make
            make test
            make pure_install

    c.  Alternatively, you can just copy or move Telnet.pm
        from the distribution into a directory named Net/ in the Perl
        library.  You can then manually build the documentation using
        pod2man or pod2html.
