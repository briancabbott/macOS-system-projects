NAME
    DateTime::Format::W3CDTF - Parse and format W3CDTF datetime strings

SYNOPSIS
      use DateTime::Format::W3CDTF;

      my $w3c = DateTime::Format::W3CDTF->new;
      my $dt = $w3c->parse_datetime( '2003-02-15T13:50:05-05:00' );

      # 2003-02-15T13:50:05-05:00
      $w3c->format_datetime($dt);

DESCRIPTION
    This module understands the W3CDTF date/time format, an ISO 8601
    profile, defined at http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime. This format as
    the native date format of RSS 1.0.

    It can be used to parse these formats in order to create the appropriate
    objects.

METHODS
    This API is currently experimental and may change in the future.

    *   parse_datetime($string)

        Given a W3CDTF datetime string, this method will return a new
        "DateTime" object.

        If given an improperly formatted string, this method may die.

    *   format_datetime($datetime)

        Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returns a W3CDTF datetime
        string.

        NOTE: As of version 0.4, format_datetime no longer attempts to
        truncate datetimes without a time component. This is due to the fact
        that "DateTime" doesn't distinguish between a date with no time
        component, and midnight.

    *   format_date($datetime)

        Given a "DateTime" object, return a W3CDTF datetime string without
        the time component.
