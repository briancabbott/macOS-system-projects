NAME

Perl4::CoreLibs - libraries historically supplied with Perl 4

DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of ".pl" files that have historically been bundled
with the Perl core but are planned not to be so distributed with
core version 5.15 or later.  Relying on their presence in the core
distribution is deprecated; they should be acquired from this CPAN
distribution instead.  From core version 5.13, until their removal,
it is planned that the core versions of these libraries will emit a
warning when loaded.  The CPAN version will not emit such a warning.

The entire Perl 4 approach to libraries was largely superseded in Perl
5.000 by the system of module namespaces and ".pm" files.  Most of the
libraries in this collection predate Perl 5.000, but a handful were
first introduced in that version.  Functionally, most have been directly
superseded by modules in the Perl 5 style.  These libraries should not
be used by new code.  This collection exists to support old Perl programs
that predates satisfactory replacements.

Most of these libraries have not been substantially maintained in the
course of Perl 5 development.  They are now very antiquated in style,
making no use of the language facilities introduced since Perl 4.
They should therefore not be used as programming examples.
