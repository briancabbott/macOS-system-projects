Revision history for perl pragma common::sense.

TODO: make it arch-specific?

3.6  Sun Jun 17 14:24:53 CEST 2012
	- work around more 5.16 breakage - $^H doesn't work as nicely as
          p5p make you to believe.
        - add features: unicode_strings current_sub fc evalbytes.
        - disable features: array_base.

3.5  Wed Mar  7 20:50:48 CET 2012
        - localise $^W, as this causes warnings with 5.16 when some lost
          soul uses -w. common::sense doesn't support $^W, but tries to
          shield module authors and programs from its ill effects. If you
          enable $^W, then you normally get to keep the pieces because you
          change semantics of other people's code.

3.4  Fri Jan 14 07:17:16 CET 2011
	- remove "regexp" category. this is rather painful as it's a large
          class, but unfortunately, somebody thought emitting a warning when you
          match more than 32kb of text is in some way useful, which spoils the whole
          category.
        - use META.json instead of META.yml - apparently YAML parsers don't actually
          exist.

3.3  Fri Jul  2 22:40:14 CEST 2010
        - removed "exiting" category - this is too useful to create new
          control statements, and fails utterly with eval, as eval will
          catch the (fatal) warning itself. Kind of hurts, but this is
          just another warning category which is too broad and has to be
          disabled fully because of a minority of issues.

3.2  Fri Apr 16 01:46:02 CEST 2010
	- removed "substr" warning - while it overall is a good category,
          "substr '', 2" is entirely sensible.

3.1  Sat Apr  3 04:56:36 CEST 2010
        - removed "parenthesis" warning:
             sysread $fh, my $buf, -s $fh; # ok
             sysread $fh, my $buf, $size;  # warning
          Made no sense to me, especially as $size is in scope.
	- no longer hardcode warning/struct bits, calculate them at
          installation time, for when I will no longer be alive etc.
	- tweaked documentation.

3.0  Tue Dec 15 03:24:28 CET 2009
	- enable "use utf8" effect by default.
	- removed "utf8" warning category. while this contains useful security
          stuff, it also makes implementing security stuff almost impossible,
          as it completely mangles perls internal utf8 encoding with actual
          utf-8 encoding, and confuses "unicode", "string codepoints" and
          "utf-8" so much that it becoems practically unusable.

2.03  Wed Dec  2 18:38:53 CET 2009
	- removed "unopened" warning category, as this breaks "stat _", which
          seems to be a bug in all perl versions (see perlbug #71002).
        - some doc updates.

2.02  Wed Nov  4 12:04:08 CET 2009
	- no functional changes.
	- add META.yml clarification to the faq, tune the docs a bit
          and add a "much reduced typing" section.
        - unfortunately, the tone of the manpage has tightened and is
          more serious in many parts now. We consider this a bug that we
          plan to fix before 2100.

2.01  Mon Oct  5 17:01:48 CEST 2009
	- add a FAQ section.
	- use a more future-proof way to set the warning mask.

2.0   Tue Sep  1 20:28:25 CEST 2009
	- codename "fatality", now with big doses of... fatality.
	- enabled an enourmous number of warnings and made them FATAL,
          as warned about in earlier releases. Of course we carefully
          tested the new warnings against our modules, as mentioned
          in the manpage, too.

1.0   Sat Aug 22 22:08:50 CEST 2009
	- no functional changes.
	- really, the first version of common sense!
        - slightly improved documentation.
	- forgot to include license.

0.04  Sun Aug  2 10:29:23 CEST 2009
	- added "what others..." section.
        - reinforce attempt at world domination.

0.03  Thu Jul  9 20:16:33 CEST 2009
	- first public release, written on the Piratenstammtisch
          (http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Stammtisch_Karlsruhe).

0.01  Thu Jul  9 17:48:00 CEST 2009
	- original version; cloned from Convert::Scalar.
