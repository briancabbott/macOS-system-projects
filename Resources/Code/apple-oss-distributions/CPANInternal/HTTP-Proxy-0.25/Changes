Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Proxy

0.25 Sun Jul  3 00:28:10 CEST 2011
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - new Engine: HTTP::Proxy::Engine::Threaded, by Angelos Karageorgiou
        [FIXES]
        - Correctly call eod() when the response has no body
          (closed RT ticket #48310)

0.24 Tue Jul 21 21:28:02 CEST 2009
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - When a short-circuit response was send, the next response
          would not be filtered at all. This has been fixed.
        [FIXES]
        - yet another fix for t/23connect, proposed by Marek Rouchal
          (closed RT ticket #38995) [test skipped for now]
        - HTTP::Headers::Util's split_header_words() returns lower case
          tokens/keys since October 6, 2008. Fix by Maurice Aubrey.
          (closed RT tickets #43249, #43622)

0.23 Thu Sep  4 02:29:47 CEST 2008
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::save had an issue with cygwin because
          of an incorrect use of File::Spec's catdir(). This is fixed.
        - CONNECT requests are now forwarded to the upstream proxy, if there
          is one. Errors from the upstream proxy are relayed to the client.
        [TESTS]
        - t/23connect.t does not use sysread() anymore. This time the test
          should pass about everywhere.

0.22 Thu May  1 00:18:38 CEST 2008
        [TESTS]
        - increased test coverage
        - t/23connect.t doesn't need an Internet connection any more,
          thus closing RT ticket #19653.
        - t/67complete.t tests HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::complete
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - closed RT ticket #33465 (Jimbo), by explaining in a little
          more detail how HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::complete works.

0.21 Sun Apr 20 04:34:47 CEST 2008
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - HTTP::Proxy::Engine::Legacy and HTTP::Proxy::Engine::ScoreBoard
          log the number of remaining child processes (in addition to
          their pids), thanks to Amos Shapira.
        [FIXES]
        - HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::save had a bug that prevented the
          'filename' parameter to be correctly used to compute the 
          filename to save to, and that made the proxy die the second
          time the filter was called.
          This fix allowed to close RT tickets #14548 (Max Maischein),
          #18644 (Mark Tilford) and #33018 (Roland Stigge and Gunnar Wolf).
        - HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::save had many other bugs, which the
          test suite allowed to spot and fix.
        [TESTS]
        - t/67save.t provides 96% coverage of HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::save,
          and helped fix many bugs in it.
        - fixed t/22http.t and t/22transparent.t not to break when the
          DNS wrongly resolves an invalid address.
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - closed RT ticket #25295 (Matsuno Tokuhiro) with a doc patch.

0.20 Fri Aug 18 10:25:11 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added a will_modify() method to HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter, that
          lets the proxy know if a filter may modify the content length,
          thus closing RT ticket #21051 (Chris Dolan)
        - If no filter in the current stack will modify the content length,
          then the header is not removed
        [FIXES]
        - closed RT tickets #3184 and #20251 (chunked encoding was enforced
          while transfering data between a client and server using
          different versions of HTTP, causing unwanted garbage to appear
          in the data)
        - removed useless "ERROR: Getting request failed:" messages
          when there are simply "No more requests from this connection"
        [INTERNALS]
        - Removed the HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack class from inside HTTP::Proxy
          and put it in its own module file
        - renamed HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack::active() as will_modify() for
          consistency reasons
        [TESTS]
        - updated t/22http.t and t/23connect.t following Ken Williams'
          recommandations in RT ticket #19986
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - patched a small inconsistency in HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter's
          documentation (and closed RT ticket #20303)
        - fully documented HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack

0.19 Fri Apr 28 19:55:41 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter::simple now lets one define an
          end() method as well
        [FIXES]
        - HTTP::Proxy::(Body|Header)Filter::simple now provide a default
          filter() that does nothing if their constructor is not given one
          (thanks to Merijn Brand)
        - close RT ticket #14548 by correcting the 'filename' check
          in HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::save (Max Maischein)
        - ERROR messages are always logged (Mark Tilford)
        [TESTS]
        - more tests for log() and logmask() in t/11log.t

0.18 Sun Mar 19 23:49:38 CET 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - the new known_methods() method can return all method
          names know to HTTP::Proxy (can be helpful with the
          method parameter of push_filter())
        [FIXES]
        - close RT ticket #14898 by using a per-parent lockfile for
          HTTP::Proxy::Engine::ScoreBoard (Chris Dolan)
        - close RT ticket #18243 by adding missing DeltaV methods
          (Stephen Steneker)
        [EXAMPLES]
        - eg/perlmonks.pl   - redirect perlmonks.com to perlmonks.org

0.17 Wed Sep 28 23:25:17 CEST 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Thanks to Randal Schwartz, a new HTTP::Proxy::Engine::ScoreBoard
          engine is available. I've benchmarked a twofold speed increase.
          This engine is still beta, you must enable it by hand.

0.16  Thu Sep  1 19:13:55 CEST 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - the new HTTP::Proxy::Engine class and its subclasses
          now handle the life and death of child processes
        - the Content-Length header is now removed only if body
          filters will be applied on the response body
        - HTTP::Proxy now supports some Apache-like attributes
          (start_servers, max_clients, max_requests_per_child,
          min_spare_servers, max_spare_servers, keep_alive,
          max_keep_alive_requests, keep_alive_timeout)
        - added support for ALL WebDAV/DeltaV methods
        - the query argument to push_filter(), added in 0.14, should
          now work (thanks to Simon Cozens for spotting the problem)
        - the proxy now has a stash, which is a hash where filters can
          store data (possibly to share it). (Requested by Mark Fowler)
          Warning: since the proxy forks for each TCP connection, the
          data is only shared between filters in the same child process.
        [DEPRECATION]
        - the maxchild, maxconn and maxserve accessors are now
          deprecated. They will disappear in the future:
          + maxchild has no replacement (should be handled by the engine)
          + maxconn becomes max_connections
          + maxserve becomes max_keep_alive_requests
        - Information regarding the way the engine should behave
          must passed in the constructor or directly to the engine
        [NEW METHODS]
        - $proxy->engine() return the HTTP::Proxy::Engine instance
        - $proxy->new_connection() increase the TCP connections counter
          (should only be used by HTTP::Proxy::Engine object)
        [FIXES]
        - Makefile.PL was not playing nice with Build.PL in the
          previous distributions. This has been fixed. Sorry for the
          inconvenience
        - no more annoying "getsockname() on closed socket GEN0"
          warnings (they appeared in 0.14)
        [Win32 SUPPORT]
        - Win32 is now supported! badly supported, but supported...
        - until someone writes a decent engine for Win32, the default
          Win32 engine will be HTTP::Proxy::Engine::NoFork, which
          can only handle a single TCP connection at a time
        [EXAMPLES]
        - eg/yahoogroups.pl - removes ad interruptions from Yahoo! Groups
        - eg/https.pl       - peek/poke at encrypted web pages
        - eg/logger.pl      - improved the logger script

0.15  Tue Apr  5 21:17:40 CEST 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added support for WebDAV methods (requested by Christian Laursen)
        - The filter selection is based on the original request and response,
          as it should
        - improved kwalitee
        [DEPRECATION]
        - the start() method is no longer supported in HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter
          subclasses. Use begin() instead.
        [EXAMPLES]
        - eg/pdf.pl    - save \.pdf files and send a HTML confirmation instead
                         (idea by Emmanuel Di Prétoro)

0.14  Tue Mar 29 11:40:51 CEST 2005
        [ANNOUNCE]
        - It's been more than a year since last release, which is bad.
          I now plan to release new versions more often, maybe about
          once a month, or when there are big changes.
        [DEPRECATION]
        - the start() method of HTTP::Proxy::Bodyfilter subclasses
          is renamed begin(), since it now has an end() counterpart.
          (On a related note, I improve my English. Be sure to check out
          http://www.landgren.net/perl/lt-2004.html for details)          
        - start() in filters is therefore declared deprecated, an error
          message is logged. The start() method will not be called any
          more as from 0.15.
        - the FILTER constant is now named FILTERS. FILTER will disappear
          in 0.15 as well.
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - subclasses of HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter can now have a
          finalisation method, named end()
        - the start^Wbegin() method of HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter subclasses
          now receive the message as an argument
        - new built-in filter: HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::save
          that can save the message body to a file while browsing
        - new built-in filter: HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::complete
          that stores the message body in memory and passes it on to the
          next filters only when it's complete
        - logs have cleaner prefixes and the pid is always shown
        - should work under 5.005_03 (Thanks to Mathieu Arnold)
        - transparent proxying support (mostly to please Martin Zdila
          and Paul Makepeace)
        - push_filter() should now accept the query parameter
        [FIXES]
        - the FILTER constant is now named FILTERS
        [BUGS]
        - the proxy does not work under Win32, except if you force
          maxchild to 0 (no forking at all).
        - t/20dummy.t (and a few otrhers) hanged under Win32
          + Ken Hirsch proposed a patch for HTTP::Daemon
            (and a workaround for HTTP::Proxy's daemon object)
          + Bruno De Fraine tracked down the problem to the fork()
            emulation by Windows threads under Win32 that lead to
            a deadlock.
          => both explanations cover the same problem, which I haven't
             been able to correct yet
        - all the tests that fork a proxy and a server are therefore
          skipped under Win32. This is ugly, and will change in the future.
        [EXAMPLES]
        - eg/rfc.pl    - save rfc\d+\.txt files as we browse them
        - eg/js.pl     - save \.js files as we browse them
        - eg/dragon.pl - enhance the Dragon Go Server web site
        - eg/fudd.pl   - make the web tawk wike Ewmer J. Fudd
        - eg/switch.pl - switch proxies as you browse
        - Changed all the examples so that they can take HTTP::Proxy::new()
          parameters on the command-line (so, call them with logmask 3,
          for example)
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - documentation for the filter initialisation methods
        - removed all references to the so-called "store-and-forward"
          mechanism (see HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::complete)

0.13  Wed Mar  3 17:36:31 CET 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - CONNECT support (but only transparently...)
        - the client_headers() method (similar to hop_headers()) give
          the filters access to the proxy's LWP::UA Client-* headers
        - filters are applied on all supported methods by default
        [FIXES]
        - removed everything regarding control() and control_regex(),
          which were not used and confusing
        [TESTS]
        - tests for CONNECT support
        - tests for SSL support (not working yet)
        [EXAMPLES]
        - eg/adblock.pl    - a very simple adblocker
        - eg/trim.pl       - trims whitespace from HTML pages 
        - eg/javascript.pl - add any text right after <body>
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - separate COPYRIGHT and LICENSE sections in all man pages

0.12  Thu Jan 22 23:54:03 CET 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - send the error message to the client when the Proxy agent dies
          (usually because of a filter error)
        - the proxy now sends a X-Forwarded-For header by default
          (and the proxy method x_forwarded_for can toggle this)
        - the proxy method client_socket() gives access to the socket
          connected to the current client (the example in Changes for 0.10
          was wrong: one can get the IP address of the connected agent from
          inside a filter with $self->proxy->client_socket->peerhost)
        [FIXES]
        - do not block simultaneous connections when not forking
        - clean up the filter chain after the body-request filters
        - ensure the filter stack is reinitialised between requests
        [TESTS]
        - tests for X-Forwarded-For
        - test the proxy against http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/
        [EXAMPLES]
        - eg/post.pl   - outputs the URI and parameters of all POST requests
        - eg/logger.pl - outputs details of GET and POST requests

0.11  Fri Jan  2 17:02:08 CET 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - setting maxchild to 0 prevents forking (Jim Cromie)
        - filters can now match on the query string
        - hop-by-hop headers and Max-Forwards headers are correctly supported
        - new mutators added to HTTP::Proxy: via, hop_headers, request,
          response
        - filters can now answer in place of the server, which allows
          for authorisation filters, cache (?) filters, etc.
        - new examples scripts: proxy-auth.pl
        [FIXES]
        - push_filter() now correctly supports several match criteria
        [TESTS]
        - all the Via: header tests are now in t/50via.t
        - t/50standard.t now checks headers for several request types
        - new tests:
          + t/51simple2.t - check response header filters with an actual proxy
          + t/61simple2.t - check response body filters with an actual proxy
        [INTERNALS]
        - new method _send_response_headers

0.10  Wed Nov 19 01:36:59 CET 2003

        *** MAJOR INTERFACE CHANGES ***

        - new base classes HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter and
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter
        - some useful built-in filter classes:
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::htmlparser
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::htmltext
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::lines
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::simple
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::tags
          HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter::simple
          HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter::standard
        - tests for the internal class HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack
        - tests for the built-in filters
        - the examples are up-to-date with the new interface 
        - new/enhanced accessors:
          + the proxy host() attribute becomes actually useful: by default,
            the proxy is only usable by local user-agents (the socket
            is bound to localhost)
          + the filters proxy() accessor gives access to the proxy itself.
            For example, one can get the IP address of the agent connected
            to the proxy from inside a filter ($self->proxy->daemon->peerhost)
        - many documentation changes

        This version is NOT compatible with the previous ones
        regarding the way filters work.

        *** MAJOR INTERFACE CHANGES ***

0.08  Thu Mar 13 01:41:42 CET 2003
        - cleaned up support for filters
        - added support for "buffering" filters
          and a new HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack class
        - added an anonymiser script (eg/anonymiser.pl)
        - the tests won't break if a local proxy is configured

0.06  Mon Feb 17 00:21:37 CET 2003
        - better forking system and better reaping of zombies
          (thanks to David Landgren and Stéphane Payrard)
          Still won't work under Windows, though :-(
        - replaced verbose() by logmask(), so as to fine-tune
          the logging system
        - put some of the test functions in a test module (t::Utils)

0.05  Tue Feb  4 00:47:23 CET 2003

        - new 'control' attribute defines the control URL
        - better subprocess management by preforking child processes
          (thanks to Eric Cholet)
        - a children handles only one request at a time, for better
          performance (this means we only do HTTP/1.0 for now)
        - correctly handle the Proxy-Connection and Connection headers

0.02  Thu Oct 24 23:45:08 CEST 2002
        - the system now forks to handle several connections
        - but needs better test suites
