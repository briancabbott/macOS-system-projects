Revision history for Perl extension File::NFSLock.

1.21  Jul 13 17:00 2011
        - Various patches by Chorny at cpan dot org
          and fREW frioux at gmail dot com:
        - Windows NTFS compatibility fixes.
        - Allow PID to be negative.
        - Lexically scope temp file handles to
          reduce changes of memory leak and
          avoid unintentional glob clobberation.
        - Security fix: 3 arg open().
        - Repair test suites logics.
        - Fixed infinite freezing on Strawberry Perl v5.10.0.
        - Fixed infinite freezing on ActiveState Perl v5.12.1.
        - Sorry for the past 8 years of suffering.

1.20  May 13 12:00 2003
        - Avoid double reverting signal handlers when
          unlock() is explicitly called instead of
          implicitly called from DESTROY().
        - Fixed this warning:
          Argument "DEFAULT" isn't numeric in numeric eq (==)

1.19  Dec 17 23:30 2002
        - Minor code cleanup patch by Stephen Waters.

1.18  Jul 25 17:00 2002
        - Add newpid() method to handle fork() conditions.

1.17  Jun 10 12:00 2002
        - Handle system crash recovery better or
          other abnormal/abrupt termination (like SIGKILL)
          conditions more gracefully.

1.16  Jun 05 15:00 2002
        - Allow exclusive lock to be obtained on
          the same file multiple times by the
          the same process.

1.15  Jun 04 09:00 2002
        - Default to catch certain signals to avoid
          creating stale locks on graceful termination.
        - More tests to test signal handlers.
        - Fix test t/300_bl_sh.t to measure only
          what is required.

1.14  Jun 03 12:00 2002
        - Add test to exploit unlock bug
          (fixed by Andy in 1.13)
        - Less anal tests for slower platforms
          (Slowaris) to succeed as well.

1.13  May 30 12:00 2002
        - Add spec file for RPM packaging.
        - Show example in perldoc using numerical constants.
        - Make perldoc example strict clean.
        - Add INSTALL section to perldoc.
        - Fixed bug that forced a lock aquired by another
          process to be released when an exclusive lock
          attempt fails.
          Patch by andyh@myinternet.com.au (Andy Hird)

1.12  Nov 05 12:00 2001
        - Change code to utilize numerical constants
          instead of the magic strings.
        - Change several sub routines into methods
          of the object to reduce arguments passed.
        - Avoid double unlocking (DESTROY).
        - Added some nice tests.
        - Pulled out stale_lock code to check once
          at initial lock attempt instead of repeated
          checks during the blocking lock loop.
          This may change functionality slightly in
          that a lock will never "become" stale if
          it wasn't already stale when the lock
          attempt initiated.
        - Shared lock feature now functional.

1.11  Oct 30 12:00 2001
        - (Not released)
        - Initial attempt to add shared lock feature.

1.10  Jul 31 10:10 2001
        - Allow for numerical constants from Fcntl.
        - Return Error status in $errstr.
        - Allow for custom lock extensions via $LOCK_EXTENSION.
        - Allow for passing parameters as a hashref
        - Allow for stale_lock_timeout parameter

1.00  May 24 10:50 2001
        - Initial release of File::NFSLock.
        - Release under 1.00 tag as this is already in use.
        - Blocking and Nonblocking locking is possible.
        - uncache routine is available.
