Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum is an XS perl module designed to provide basic
access to the OpenSSL multiprecision integer arithmetic libraries.
Presently, many though not all of the arithmetic operations that
OpenSSL provides are exposed to perl.  In addition, this module can be
used to provide access to bignum values produced by other OpenSSL
modules, such as key parameters from Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA.  This module
requires that the OpenSSL libraries and header files be installed.

Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum is currently under active development, and the
many of the arithmetic APIs may change.  However, the author is
committed to greater stability of the following methods:

  new_from_bin, new_from_hex, new_from_decimal
  to_bin, to_hex, to_decimal
  pointer_copy, bless_pointer

The module is being developed on sourceforge; if you find something
you like or hate, please come to http://perl-openssl.sf.net/ for
