In object oriented abstractions you often model real things as Perl classes.
Unfortunately, the Perl classes have uglier names than the real things do.

For example, I might model a customer using a Foo::Customer class.

It would be useful if the Foo::Customer class knew what I would call its
associated real thing.

UNIVERSAL::moniker enables classes to make a good guess at what they would be
called in the real world.

	Foo::User->moniker eq "user";

	my $a = Big::Scary::Animal->new;
	$c->moniker eq "animal";

	my $o = Cephalopod::Octopus->new;
	$o->plural_moniker eq "octopuses";

NAME
    UNIVERSAL::moniker

SYNOPSIS
      use UNIVERSAL::moniker;

DESCRIPTION
    Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good
    when written in prose. For this reason, we tend to say things like
    "customer" or "basket" when we are referring to
    "My::Site::User::Customer" or "My::Site::Shop::Basket". We thought it
    would be nice if our classes knew what we would prefer to call them.

    This module will add a "moniker" (and "plural_moniker") method to
    "UNIVERSAL", and so to every class or module.

  moniker
      $ob->moniker;

    Returns the moniker for $ob. So, if $ob->isa("Big::Scary::Animal"),
    "moniker" will return "animal".

  plural_moniker
      $ob->plural_moniker;

    Returns the plural moniker for $ob. So, if
    $ob->isa("Cephalopod::Octopus"), "plural_moniker" will return
    "octopuses".

    (You need to install Lingua::EN::Inflect for this to work.)
