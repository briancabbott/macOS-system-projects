1.17 Mon Oct. 23, 2006
    - make loading of Scalar::Util::weaken, completely 
      optional
    - added a $post_func optional arg to &traverse. Thanks 
      to Mark Lawrence for the patch, docs and tests :)

1.16 Mon Feb. 6, 2006
    - converted to use Module::Build (Rob Kinyon)
    - refactored &addChild and &addChildren to be 
      implemented in terms of &insertChild and 
      &insertChildren (Rob Kinyon)
    - other misc. refactorings (Rob Kinyon)
    - updated Scalar::Util version dependency (Stevan Little)
    - updated copyrights for the new year (Stevan Little)        

1.15 Thurs May 26, 2005
    - added optional use of weakened parent references
      and improved the old circular reference DESTROY
      model to make more sense. See the documantation 
      for more info.
    - fixed bug in the fixDepth() function

1.14 Thurs Nov 18 2004
    - now using Scalar::Util::blessed() instead of 
      the convoluted UNIVERSAL::isa() stuff. 
      - added Scalar::Util as a dependency

1.13 Mon Nov 15 2004
    - added width functionality (with getWidth), 
      thanks to Mark Thomas for his insight/suggestions
        - added tests for this
        - added documentation for this
    - improved the height functionality, thanks again
      to Mark Thomas for his insight/suggestions
        - deprecated the 'height' method in favor 
          of the more consistent 'getHeight' method
        - added tests for this
        - added documentation for this
    - added some info in the docs to explain the depth
      value for ROOT trees.
    - cleaned up and improved the following test files 
      	> 11_Tree_Simple_fixDepth_test.t
        > 13_Tree_Simple_clone_test.t

1.12 Thurs Oct 7 2004
    - fixed the clone method, it was not correctly
      cloning parental relationships
        - added tests and docs for this
    - improved clone and cloneShallow with the addition
      of the _cloneNode utility function, we now deep
      clone the nodes
        - added test and docs for this

1.11 Mon Oct 4 2004
    - some documentation changes, no code changes

1.10 Tues Aug 31 2004
    - streamlined the DESTROY method to avoid method
      calls as this can sometimes cause issues during 
      global destruction with subclasses.

1.09 Tues Aug 31 2004
    - Fixed DESTROY to avoid memory leaks (RT-BUG: #7512) 
        - added documentation to explain when to call 
          the DESTROY method to properly clean up any
          circular references
        - added test (14_Tree_Simple_leak_test.t) to 
          verify this fix (needs Test::Memory::Cycle to run)
  
1.08 Wed Aug 25 2004
    - added the 'height' and 'size' methods
        - added tests for these
        - added documentation for these
  
1.07 Wed July 28 2004
    - Added the getUID and setUID methods to Tree::Simple, thanks
      to Brett Nuske for that suggestion.
      - added documentation for these methods
      - added tests for those methods
    - added t/pod.t and t/pod_coverage.t to the test suite
                    
1.06 Mon July 6 2004
    - Changed what the Tree::Simple accept method accepts
        - added tests for this
    - Completely Revised the Tree::Simple::Visitor object
      so that it is a better base class. This coincides with
      the release of the Tree::Simple::VisitorFactory collection
      of Visitor objects.
        - added tests for this
    
1.05 Sun June 6th 2004
    - Fixed some vagueness in the documentation as well 
      as made sure that the ROOT constant could be given
      as a the $parent argument.
    
1.04 Tues May 18th 2004
    - The second argument to the Tree::Simple constructor
      was a parent, and that argument was not getting 
      properly type checked before attempting to call 
      'addChild' on it. Now it is properly type checked
      and will throw an exception if it is not correct.
    
1.03 Sun May 9 2004
    - I have added a new method 'getIndex', which will 
      fetch the index of the current tree within it's 
      parent's child list. I have also added documentation
      and tests for this.
    
1.02 Sun May 2 2004
    - I thought about the API change, and I decided that 
      the new method (removeChildAt($index)) did not make 
      sense. It made more sense for removeChild to accept
      both $child and an $index, and do the right thing 
      based upon which one was given. This of course
      is how it works anyway since I maintained backwards
      compatability. But take note, removeChildAt($index)
      will not be supported. The method is still there, 
      but it will very soon go away. 
      I think this is a cleaner way to do this in the end.
          
1.01 Wed April 28 2004
    - Made API change:
        - removeChild($index) is now removeChildAt($index)
          and removeChild($child) has replaced it. See the
          documentation for more info.
        - backwards compatability maintained under change.
        - new tests written to test the new code and to 
          test the backwards compatability
    - Test suite is not at 99% coverage (with 415 tests)
    - Moved object initialization code from Tree::Simple::Visitor::new      
      to Tree::Simple::Visitor::_init. This keeps in line with the
      Tree::Simple code and the seperation of object creation and 
      initialization.
      
1.0  Mon April 5 2004
    - I dont know why, but I was wary of calling this 1.0
	  but that is really what it is. I think too many modules
	  avoid that number, but I am not gonna do that. So here
	  goes, its 1.0 baby!!

Note: Being new to this versioning thing, I was actually going 
for a "minor" version thing with the jump from 0.3 to 0.14. I 
realized that was not only dumb, but incorrect. But in realizing
this, I decided this is really 1.0 code anyway and took the plunge.
	  
0.15 Mon April 5 2004
    - Made a few adjustments:
	  - changed to UNIVERSAL::isa($object, "Class") so as to 
	    avoid warnings if non-object refs are passed
	- added more tests to the Tree::Simple::Visitor object
	- added more tests to check for non-object-refs passed
	  where they shouldnt be.
	  
0.14  Sun April 4 2004
    - I feel this module is ready for serious use. I have been
	  using it in production environments for almost 2 years now,
	  and I have recently beefed up the test suite as well. It now
	  has 371 tests with approx. 95% code coverage. I feel the code
	  is solid as is the API (although some people dont like my 
	  Java-esque naming style, but hey whatta ya do). Most of this
	  release is just tweaking and fine tuning of code, and updating
	  of the documentation.

0.03  Thu April 1 2004
	- Like an idiot i forgot to change the version number
	  from version 0.01 to 0.02 and because of CPAN's security
	  restriction about uploading files with a duplicate name
	  I have to up the version number. 

0.02  Thu April 1 2004
    - first revision:
	    - fixed a few bugs
		- improved error messages
		- added tests:
			- test for exceptions
			- checked test coverage with Devel::Cover

0.01  Thu Mar 11 10:46:33 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-X -n Tree::Simple
