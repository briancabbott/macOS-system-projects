Perltidy TODO List
  This is a partial "wish-list" of features to add and things to do.

  Provide an option to ignore side comments when checking line length.  
    That is, side comments would be allowed to be arbitrarily long without
    influencing line breaks. 

  Improved Vertical Alignment
    There are still many opportunities for improving vertical alignment.

  Minimize the instances in which formatting changes on a second iteration.  

  Add a convergence test when -it=n is used

  Documentation
    A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting issues,
    and to give examples of different styles.

    The -formatter callback object documentation is incomplete.

  HTML writer
    The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
    documents or quoted strings. The tokenizer outputs interpolation
    information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
    multi-line quotes. Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
    identifiers.

Things which have been suggested but will not be done
  Recursive file processing
    A -r flag might be nice, but this is best handled by an exterior shell
    script.

  Make perltidy support the syntax of some module XXX.
    This generally won't be done unless the module is part of the core perl
    distribution.  But in some cases it might be possible to use the prefilter 
    and postfilter capabilities of the Tidy.pm module to help.
