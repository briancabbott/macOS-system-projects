        * lib/Net/Daemon.pm Patched per bug 32887
	  "ithreads not detected due to a typo"
2011-02-22  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.46)
        * lib/Net/Daemon.pm Fixed "Subroutine import redefined" problem
	  that perl 5.8.8 CPAN testers was getting.  It was due to
	  more than one "require threads" being run.
	* distribution.  Bumped up the version number first.
2011-02-18  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.45)
        * lib/Net/Daemon.pm Used "make dist" to create the uploaded
	* distribution.  Bumped up the version number first.
2011-02-17  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.44)
        * lib/Net/Daemon.pm Added ServClose patch by Gaspar Chilingarov
	* t/thread.t Added patches by Daniel Macks and Joe McMahon,
	  and added Test::More and skip_all for Windows < 5.10
2009-03-12  Joe McMahon     <mcmahon@blekko.com> (0.44)
       * Added necessary thread sharing to work with 5.10
         threads model: regexp-threads,
       * Bumped minimum required perl to 5.10 for t/threads.t tests
2007-06-17  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.43)
        * lib/Net/Daemon.pm  Needed to up the VERSION number
2007-06-16  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.42)
        * t/forkm.t: Added a wait so that the parent will not loop
	  around and make another child until the previous child has
	  been destroyed.
2007-05-23  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.41)
        * t/forkm.t: When all ten childs are exited,
	  sub CatchChild will now exit.
2007-05-16  Malcolm Nooning  <m.nooning@comcast.net> (0.40)
	* t/threadm.t: The tests are now skipped with a
	  passing indication when usethreads is defined, which
	  would mean that the ithreadm tests are the ones that
	  matter.
	  Test.pm: A patch from todd.e.rinaldo was used.  I do
	  not remember what the issues were.

2006-02-15  Jochen Wiedmann  <jwied@cpan.org> (0.39)

        * t/forkm.t: Hopefully, I finally got rid of the
	  problem with the forking tests. It seems, that
	  the perlipc manual got updated in the past years,
	  most possibly for the same reason: A child handler
	  must be written to catch childs in a loop.

2003-11-10  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.38)

	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm: It is now possible to specify
	  user/group root (aka 0). (rgreab@fx.ro)
 	* Added mode 'ithreads'. (Bill Jackson,
 	  <bjackson@ah.ddiglobal.com>)
 	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm (Bind): The parent process is
 	  now explicitly closing the client socket in fork
 	  mode. (Thought this would happen automatically
 	  due to garbage collection, but possibly it
 	  doesn't.) Tulsi Ram Mayala,
 	  <tulsi_rammayala@pspl.co.in>

2002-08-20  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.37)

	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm (Bind): The server died, if
	  accepting a connection failed. Fixed.
	  Nathan Mueller <nmueller@cs.wisc.edu>

2001-11-12  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.36)

	* For whatever reason, Thread->self returns undef
	  under ActivePerl. This is now handled properly
	   in Net::Daemon::Log. 

2001-04-08  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.35)

	* Added preforked childs to mode 'single'. (Gerald Richter,
	  <richter@ecos.de>)
	* t/server (Run): Child process is now waiting one second
	  in forking mode. Helps the script t/forkm.t to run fine.
	  (Radu Greab <radu@netsoft.ro>)

2000-12-22  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.34)

	* Changed "kill 1" to "kill 'TERM'" when working with fork.
	  Thanks to Torsten Foertsch (torsten.foertsch@gmx.net), in
	  particular for his explanations on the rationale behind
	  SIGHUP.

2000-11-07  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.32)
	
	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm: SigChildHandler is now always returning
	  undef or IGNORE.

2000-06-26  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.31)

	* lib/Net/Daemon/Log.pm (OpenLog): Same thing for FreeBSD. Thanks

1999-11-14  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.29)

	* lib/Net/Daemon/Log.pm (Fatal): Now displaying the callers
	  error line and file, rather than that of the Fatal() method.

1999-09-26  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.28)

	* lib/Net/Daemon/Log.pm: Added LogTime method. 
          Stefan Engel <St_Engel@gmx.net>

	  of $socket->peerhost() when logging the clients IP address.
          Stefan Engel <St_Engel@gmx.net>
	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm: Made 'IGNORE' the default for $SIG{'CHLD'}
	  on Solaris. Stefan Engel <St_Engel@gmx.net>

1999-08-11  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.27)

	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm (Bind): Under Linux the CHLD signal is now
	  ignored, due to a suggestion of Gaal Yahas <gaal@forum2.org>.
	  Required because zombies have been created under heavy load.

1999-08-11  Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.26)

	* lib/Net/Daemon/Test.pm (Child): Fixed handling of "." in
	  directory names. Thanks to Tom Lowery, <tlowery@dsioj.dla.mil>.
	* t/threadm.t (MyChild): Use of alarm() now depends on a working
	  alarm() function. (Not working under Win32.) Thanks to Tom
	  Lowery, <tlowery@dsioj.dla.mil>

1999-07-24  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.25)

	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm: Added the Loop method and the loop-timeout
	  option.

1999-07-12  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.24)

	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm (Bind): Moved PID file creation before
	  chroot. Benjamin Ritcey <Benjamin.Ritcey@tfn.com>
	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm (Bind): Added use of the Proc::Daemon::Init
	  module, if present.

1999-06-27  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (0.21)

	* lib/Net/Daemon.pm (Bind): Under Solaris the accept() call
	  can fail with a value of EINTR if a SIGCHLD was catched.
	  This is trapped now. Thanks to Brady Montz <bradym@cs.arizona.edu>.

1999-03-20  Liraz Siri       <liraz_siri@usa.net> (0.20)
	* skipped to 0.2 since I've independantly made modifications,
	  and I'd like to avoid conflict.
	* unix domain support.
