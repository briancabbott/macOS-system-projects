	* Fixed an @opts name that was causing crypt.t to fail.
	  Namely, changed 'cipher' to 'usercipher', but only in @opts,
	  because the tests invoked by crypt.t were looking to match
	  'usercipher' to get the user key.

	* The RPC::PlServer::Comm module is now being used as
	  an encapsulated object $self->{'comm'}. It has
	  definitely been a design flaw to use like it has
	  been.
	* The client is no longer bound to a maximum message size
	  of 65536 bytes. Emile, <emile at tunix.nl>
