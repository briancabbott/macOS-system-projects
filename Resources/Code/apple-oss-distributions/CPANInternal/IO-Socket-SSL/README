IO::Socket::SSL is a class implementing an object oriented
interface to SSL sockets. The class is a descendent of
IO::Socket::INET.

In order to use IO::Socket::SSL you need to have Net::SSLeay
v1.21 or newer installed but at least version 1.30 is recommended
to support features like session caching.

To support the checks for common name and subject alternative
names (verify_hostname_of_cert) you need at least Net::SSLeay
version 1.33. Unfortunatly this version was not yet released
at the time IO::Socket::SSL version 1.14 was released, so you
might try the release Net::SSLeay 1.33_01 or better use the most
current version from SVN at svn://svn.debian.org/net-ssleay/
because 1.33_01 still contained critical bugs (see 
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/net-ssleay/?rev=222&sc=1)

For those who do not have a built-in random number generator
(including most users of Solaris), you should install one
before attempting to install IO::Socket::SSL.  If you don't
already have a favorite, try "egd" (egd.sourceforge.net) or
one of the other "Related Projects" listed on its home page.
If you want to bypass the test for existence of the RNG, then
set the "SKIP_RNG_TEST" environment variable to a true value.

In addition to providing a general OO interface to SSL sockets,
this package can be used with libwww-perl.

installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
