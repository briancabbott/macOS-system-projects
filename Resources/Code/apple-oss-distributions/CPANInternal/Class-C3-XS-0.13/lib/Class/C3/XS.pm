=head1 NAME

Class::C3::XS - XS speedups for Class::C3

=head1 SUMMARY

  use Class::C3; # Automatically loads Class::C3::XS
                 #  if it's installed locally

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains XS performance enhancers for L<Class::C3> version
0.16 and higher.  The main L<Class::C3> package will use this
package automatically if it can find it.  Do not use this
package directly, use L<Class::C3> instead.

The test suite here is not complete, although it does verify
a few basic things.  The best testing comes from running the
L<Class::C3> test suite *after* this module is installed.

This module won't do anything for you if you're running a
version of L<Class::C3> older than 0.16.  (It's not a
dependency because it would be circular with the optional
dep from that package to this one).
