NAME
    Class::C3::XS - XS speedups for Class::C3

SUMMARY
      use Class::C3; # Automatically loads Class::C3::XS
                     #  if it's installed locally

DESCRIPTION
    This contains XS performance enhancers for Class::C3 version 0.16 and
    higher. The main Class::C3 package will use this package automatically
    if it can find it. Do not use this package directly, use Class::C3
    instead.

    The test suite here is not complete, although it does verify a few basic
    things. The best testing comes from running the Class::C3 test suite
    *after* this module is installed.

    This module won't do anything for you if you're running a version of
    Class::C3 older than 0.16. (It's not a dependency because it would be
    circular with the optional dep from that package to this one).
