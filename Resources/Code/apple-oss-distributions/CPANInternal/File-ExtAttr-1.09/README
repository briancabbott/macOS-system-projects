File-ExtAttr version 1.09
=========================

File::ExtAttr is a Perl module providing access to the extended attributes
of files.

Extended attributes are metadata associated with a file.
Examples are access control lists (ACLs) and other security parameters.
But users can add their own key=value pairs.

Extended attributes may not be supported by your operating system.
This module is aimed at Linux, Unix or Unix-like operating systems
(e.g.: Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD).

Extended attributes may also not be supported by your filesystem
or require special options to be enabled for a particular filesystem
(e.g. "mount -o user_xattr /dev/hda1 /some/path").

Please see the POD documentation for more detailed information
("perldoc File::ExtAttr").

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Installation requires a C compiler.

"make test" will fail if the filesystem you are building and running
the test suite does not support extended attributes. You can use
the "ATTR_TEST_DIR" environment variable to make the test suite
use a different file system, e.g.:

  mkdir -p /path/to/somewhere/with/extattr/test-dir
  export ATTR_TEST_DIR=/path/to/somewhere/with/extattr/test-dir
  make test

DEPENDENCIES

On Linux, you will need to install the package that provides
the header files <attr/attributes.h> and <attr/xattr.h>. On Fedora
you can install these as follows:

  yum -y install libattr-devel

This module requires these other modules:

  Carp
  Scalar::Util

This module's test suite is enhanced by the presence of the following
modules:

  Test::Distribution
  Test::Pod
  File::Find::Rule
  Module::CoreList
