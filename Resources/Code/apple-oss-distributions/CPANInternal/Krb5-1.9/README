Krb5 provides an object oriented interface to the most commonly used
functions included in the Kerberos 5 API.  It was developed and tested
using Perl 5.005_03 and MIT Kerberos 5 version 1.0.5 and 1.1.1.

NOTE: This module is very out of date, though it should still work with recent
Kerberos 5 libraries.  Version 2.0 will be a well deserved, complete rewrite.
Following version 1.9, only bug fixes will be released for the 1.x series.

Your comments and bug reports are welcome.  Please send them to me at
jeff@smashing.org.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
o Perl 5.004_04 or later (may work with 5.003).
o Build, test and install MIT Kerberos 5 version 1.0.5 or later.


BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------
Krb5 is built and installed in the usual Perl module fashion:

1) edit Makefile.PL and change the variables in the top section according
   to your Kerberos 5 configuration.
2) perl Makefile.PL
3) make
4) make test (not implemented yet)
5) make install


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
'make' should create man pages for Krb5 which will be installed upon a
'make install'.  Perl POD documentation is supplied in Krb5.pm, which can
be viewed by typing 'perldoc Krb5'.

Take a look at the sample and simple clients and servers for some
practical examples. 

NOTE: The documentation assumes familiarity with Kerberos 5 and Kerberos
programming.  Please see the Kerberos documentation for gory details.


BUGS & PROBLEMS
---------------
o The contents of a new Krb5::Address object needs to be converted to
  network byte order before being passed to Krb5::Address->new().
  If this is not done, many functions like mk_priv and rd_priv will fail
  on little-endian platforms.  I will try to make this automatic in a
  future version.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------
Thanks to Doug MacEachern for handing off this module to me, although I'm
sure he was glad to get it off his back!

Valuable code contributions from Scott Hutton (shutton@indiana.edu).
