Config::Std version 0.901

This module implements yet another damn configuration-file system.

The configuration language is deliberately simple and limited, and the
module works hard to preserve as much information (section order,
comments, etc.) as possible when a configuration file is updated.

See Chapter 19 of "Perl Best Practices" (O'Reilly, 2005) for the
rationale for this approach.
