NAME
    Data::Dump - Pretty printing of data structures

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump qw(dump ddx);

     $str = dump(@list);
     @copy_of_list = eval $str;

     # or use it for easy debug printout
     ddx localtime;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provide functions that takes a list of values as their
    argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl
    code that, when "eval"ed, produces a deep copy of the original
    arguments.

    The main feature of the module is that it strives to produce output that
    is easy to read. Example:

        @a = (1, [2, 3], {4 => 5});
        dump(@a);

    Produces:

        (1, [2, 3], { 4 => 5 })

    If you dump just a little data, it is output on a single line. If you
    dump data that is more complex or there is a lot of it, line breaks are
    automatically added to keep it easy to read.
