WHAT
~~~~

This is a quick implementation of the minimal interface to Readline
libraries. The implementation is made in Perl (mostly) by Jeffrey
Friedl. The only thing this library does is to make it conformant (and
add some minimal changes, like using Term::ReadKey if present, and
correct work under xterm). 

(In fact this is an understatement now, a lot of additions are made,
see CHANGES...)

INSTALL
~~~~~~~

To install this module type

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
		or (with newer makemaker)
	make test_dynamic
		(Check whether you are satisfied with the results. Try
		to redirect stdin and/or stdout.)
	make install

You may need to install Term::ReadKey first if your system is new (Solaris
is ;-(). (Available in standard places, checked with 1.98.)

If you see something like

Can't ioctl TIOCGETP: Invalid argument at ...

this means you need ReadKey.

Note that as of 0.95 Term/ReadLine.pm is unbundled to make CPAN.pm happier.
On the other hand, if you get newer Term/ReadLine.pm (say, by installing
newer Perl) you may get more features enabled.

For most features of T::R::P one needs to look in the CHANGES file, and the
comments at the start of of readline/readline.pm.  Volunteers to make the
corresponding OO interface into POD are welcome (wrappers are available in
Term::ReadLine::Perl; see perl5db.pl for a sample usage of hairier features,
such as accessing Readline variables and methods).
