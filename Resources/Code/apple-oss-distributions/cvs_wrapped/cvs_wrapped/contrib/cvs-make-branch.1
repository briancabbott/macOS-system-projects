.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a tagged branch named
.Ar branch
in a CVS module.
.Pp
A branch in CVS has a name which corresponds to the branch itself and
can be used to identify the latest version of the files on that
branch.
There is, however, no cooresponding symbolic name for the version from
which the branch was created.
.Nm
will therefore tag the module with the symbolic name
.Ar branch-base
and then create the specified
.Ar branch .
This makes it easy to later reference the original version by name.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
expects the current working directory to contain a CVS working copy
and it will create the "-base" tag against the checked-out file
revisions.
Note that uses the
.Nm cvs tag
command; therefore any locally modified changes do not get tagged as
the base version.
.Nm
will then create specified branch and update the working copy to it.
It should be noted that locally modified (uncommitted) files remain so
until committed, and if they are committed after the branch is
created, then the commit will happen on the new branch.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
does not expect a working copy to exist and will create the specified
branch in the specified
.Ar module
directly in the repository using the 
.Nm cvs rtag
command.
.Nm
will then ask the user whether to check out the new
.Ar branch
in
.Ar module .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a
By default,
.Nm
will print its parameters and ask the user to verify that a branch
should be created with those parameters.
The
.Fl a
option disables this prompt as well as the checkout prompt which
is presented if the second synopsis form was used. A yes response is
assumed in each case.
.It Fl l
Normally, in the first synopsis form,
.Nm
creates a branch in the current directory and recursively in all
subdirectories. If the
.Fl n
option is specified,
.Nm
will create the specified
.Ar branch
only in the current working directory.
.It Fl n
If the
.Fl n
option is specified,
.Nm
will create the specified
.Ar branch ,
but will not update to it if the first synopsis form was used and will
not check it out (or prompt to check it out) if the second synopsis form
was used.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
option causes
.Nm
to be more verbose, which may aid in debugging problems.
.It Fl d Ar repository
The
.Fl d
option overrrides the value of the CVSROOT environment variable with
.Ar repository .
.It Fl b Ar base_version
The
.Fl b
option allows the user to specify what version of the module to create
the
.Ar branch
from.  The default is to branch from the main (HEAD) branch.
