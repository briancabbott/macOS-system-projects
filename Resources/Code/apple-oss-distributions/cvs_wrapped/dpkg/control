Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  It handles multiple
 developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control
 various operations, and can work over a wide area network.  The
 following tasks are not included; they can be done in conjunction with
 CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and software other
 than CVS: bug-tracking, build management (that is, make and make-like
 tools), and automated testing.
