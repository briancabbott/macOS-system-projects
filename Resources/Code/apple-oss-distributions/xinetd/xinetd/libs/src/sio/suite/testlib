# Purpose:
#		Invoke the tester script. This is necessary because the tester
#		script requires functions and /bin/sh does not support functions
#		on all OS's. This script decides what shell to use to execute
#		tester. On Suns, it uses /bin/sh. On DECstations, it uses
#		/usr/bin/ksh
#		The decision is made by checking $ARCH
#		

case "$ARCH" in
	"")
		echo "ARCH not defined. Please define it."
