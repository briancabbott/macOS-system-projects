This is the "zip" project, which comprises both zip(1) and unzip(1),
and associated tools. The canonical home page for these tools are:

Zip: <http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html>
UnZip: <http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html>

Currently, this project tracks:
Zip 3.0 (released 5 June 2008)
UnZip 6.0 (released 20 April 2009)

Imports should commit the new tarball, and change the makefiles
as appropriate.

Local modifications should be implemented as patches applied during build.
