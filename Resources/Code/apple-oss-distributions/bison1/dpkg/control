Description: Bison parser generator
 Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
 description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program to
 parse that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you may use
 it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in
 simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
 .
 Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc
 grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone familiar
 with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little trouble.
