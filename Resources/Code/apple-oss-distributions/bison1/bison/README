This directory contains the Bison parser generator.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
See the file doc/FAQ for frequently asked questions.

It was once true that, when installing Bison on Sequent (or Pyramid?)
systems, you had to be in the Berkeley universe.  This may no longer
be true; we have no way to tell.

On VMS, you will probably have to create Makefile from Makefile.in by
hand.  Remember to do `SET COMMAND BISON' to install the data in
`BISON.CLD'.

VMS and MS-DOS builds are probably broken right now.  If you are able
to build Bison on either platform and you need to make changes to do
so, please submit those changes as a bug report.

Send bug reports to bug-bison@gnu.org.  Please include the version
number from `bison --version', and a complete, self-contained test
case in each bug report.

If you have questions about using Bison which the documentation does
not answer, send mail to help-bison@gnu.org.
