    NEW FEATURES

    Added a collection of graph processing tools:

    acyclic : a filter that takes a directed graph as input
    and outputs a copy of the graph with sufficient edges
    reversed to make the graph acyclic.

    ccomps : decomposes graphs into their connected components,
    printing the components to standard output.

    colorize : is a filter that sets node colors from initial
    seed values. Colors flow along edges from tail to head.

    gc : a graph analogue to wc in that it prints to standard
    output the number of nodes, edges, connected components or
    clusters contained in the input files.

    gpr : a graph stream editor inspired by awk. It copies
    input graphs to its output, possibly transforming their
    structure and attributes, creating new graphs, or
    printing arbitrary information.

    nop : reads a stream of graphs and prints each in
    pretty-printed (canonical) format on stdout.

    sccmap : decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components
    and an auxiliary map of the relationship between components.

    tred : computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs,
    and prints the resulting graphs to standard output. This
    removes edges implied by transitivity.

    unflatten : is a preprocessor to dot that is used to improve
    the aspect ratio of graphs having many leaves or disconnected
    nodes. The usual layout for such a graph is generally very
    wide or tall. unflatten inserts invisible edges or adjusts
    the minlen on edges to improve layout compaction.


    FIXES

    Change PNG default background color from transparent to white
    because of the difficulty some viewers have with transparency.

    allocated by the layout engines.

    Some -Timap fixes for mouse sensitive graphs on web pages

    Fix for [rankdir=LR] problems when using neato layout engine
