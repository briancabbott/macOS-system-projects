* Status

                    /*--------------------------.
                    | Sane for full scale use.  |
                    `--------------------------*/

* No known serious or important bugs.

* Minor Problems

Some Makefile segments do not behave correctly in VPATH builds with proprietary
`make' programs.  Some BSD `make's will work.  For best results, build in the
source directory or use GNU `make'.

Parallel builds via `make -jN' do not work.
