.SH DESCRIPTION
.B httpd
is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It is
designed to be run as a stand-alone daemon process. When used like this
it will create a pool of child processes to handle requests. To stop
it, send a TERM signal to the initial (parent) process. The PID of
this process is written to a file as given in the configuration file.
Alternatively 
.B httpd 
may be invoked by the Internet daemon inetd(8) each
time a connection to the HTTP service is made.
.PP
This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
of the directives necessary to configure 
.B httpd
see the Apache manual,
which is part of the Apache distribution or can be found at
http://httpd.apache.org/. Paths in this manual may not reflect those
compiled into 
.B httpd.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.BI \-R " libexecdir"
This option is only available if Apache was built with
the 
.I SHARED_CORE
rule enabled which forces the Apache core code to be
placed into a dynamic shared object (DSO) file. This file
is searched in a hardcoded path under ServerRoot per default. Use this
option if you want to override it.
.TP 12
.BI \-d " serverroot"
Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to \fIserverroot\fP. This
can be overridden by the ServerRoot command in the configuration file. The
default is \fB/usr/local/apache\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f " config"
Execute the commands in the file \fIconfig\fP on startup. If \fIconfig\fP
does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to
the ServerRoot. The default is \fBconf/httpd.conf\fP.
.TP
.BI \-C " directive"
Process the configuration \fIdirective\fP before reading config files.
.TP
.BI \-c " directive"
Process the configuration \fIdirective\fP after reading config files.
.TP
.BI \-D " parameter"
Sets a configuration \fIparameter\fP which can be used with
<IfDefine>...</IfDefine> sections in the configuration files
to conditionally skip or process commands.
.TP
.B \-h
Output a short summary of available command line options.
.TP
.B \-l
Output a list of modules compiled into the server.
.TP
.B \-L
Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and
places where the directive is valid.
.TP
.B \-S
Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only shows the
virtualhost settings).
.TP
.B \-t
Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program immediately exits
after these syntax parsing with either a return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or
return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error).
.TP
.B \-T
Same as option 
.B \-t
but does not check the configured document roots. 
.TP
.B \-X
Run in single-process mode, for internal debugging purposes only; the daemon
does not detach from the terminal or fork any children. Do NOT use this mode
to provide ordinary web service.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version of 
.B httpd
, and then exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Print the version and build parameters of 
.B httpd
, and then exit.
