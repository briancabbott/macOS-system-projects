.SH NAME
rotatelogs \- rotate Apache logs without having to kill the server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotatelogs
.I logfile
.I rotationtime
.I [offset]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rotatelogs
is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's piped logfile
feature which can be used like this:

.fi
   TransferLog "| rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
.nf

This creates the files /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn where nnnn is the system
time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a multiple of
the rotation time, so you can synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the end
of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\fIlogfile\fP
The path plus basename of the logfile.  If \fBlogfile\fP includes any
\fB%\fP characters, it is treated as a format string for \fIstrftime(3)\fP.
Otherwise, the suffix .nnnn is automatically added and is the time at which
the logfile was created.
.IP \fB\fIrotationtime\fP
The rotation time in seconds.
.IP \fB\fIoffset\fP
The number of minutes offset from UTC.  If omitted, zero is assumed and
UTC is used.  For example, to use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours,
specify a value of \fI-300\fP for this argument.
