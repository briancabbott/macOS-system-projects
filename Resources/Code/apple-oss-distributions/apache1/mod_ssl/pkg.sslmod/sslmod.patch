##
## This file assembles changes to existing Apache source files
## between the original Apache and the patched variant. It can be
## automatically applied to a vanilla Apache source tree with the
## 'patch' tool to upgrade those files.  Each patch snippet is
## annotated with a short description.
##
## This file contains all patches to the Apache source tree
## which add additional (but optional) support for the SSL
## module. Those changes are just to provide a little bit more
## comfort, but aren't really required.
##

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Add the SSL_BASE and RSA_BASE variables, the SSL_XXXX rules and the
| AddModule entry for mod_ssl (libssl.a). This way an SSL-aware Apache can
| still be built with the old Apache 1.2 configuration procedure and no
| extra --activate-module=ssl is required.

+# SSL support:
+#
+# o Set SSL_BASE to either the directory of your OpenSSL source tree or the
+#   installation tree. Alternatively you can also use the value 'SYSTEM' which
+#   then indicates that OpenSSL is installed under various system locations.
+#
+# o Disable SSL_COMPAT rule to build mod_ssl without backward compatibility
+#   code for Apache-SSL 1.x, mod_ssl 2.0.x, Sioux 1.x and Stronghold 2.x.
+#
+# o The SSL_SDBM rule controls whether the built-in SDBM library should be
+#   used instead of a custom defined or vendor supplied DBM library.  Use the
+#   value 'default' for automatic determination or use 'yes' to force the use
+#   of SDBM in case the vendor DBM library is buggy or restricts the data
+#   sizes too dramatically.
+#
+# o The SSL_EXPERIMENTAL rule can be used to enable still experimental code
+#   inside mod_ssl. These are usually new features which need some more
+#   testing before they can be considered stable. So, enable this on your own
+#   risk and only when you like to see Apache+mod_ssl dump core ;-)
+#
+# o The SSL_CONSERVATIVE rule can be used to disable some non-conservative
+#   code inside mod_ssl. These are usually recently introduced features 
+#   which some people still want to consider unstable. So, to be maximum 
+#   conservative, one can enable this flag and this way remove such code.
+#
+# o The SSL_VENDOR rule can be used to enable code inside mod_ssl which can be
+#   used by product vendors to extend mod_ssl via EAPI hooks without patching
+#   the source. Additionally ssl_vendor*.c source files are automatically
+#   picked up by the compilation process.
