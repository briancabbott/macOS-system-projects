       MMaaiillqq  prints  a  summary  of the mail messages queued for
       future delivery.

       The first line printed for each message shows the internal
       identifier used on this host for the message with a possi-
       ble status character, the size of the  message  in  bytes,
       the date and time the message was accepted into the queue,
       and the envelope sender of the message.  The  second  line
       shows  the  error  message  that caused this message to be
       retained in the queue; it will not be present if the  mes-
       sage  is  being  processed for the first time.  The status
       characters are either ** to indicate the job is being  pro-
       cessed; XX to indicate that the load is too high to process
       the job; and -- to indicate that the job is  too  young  to
       process.  The following lines show message recipients, one
       per line.

       MMaaiillqq is identical to ``sendmail -bp''.

       The relevant options are as follows:

       --AAcc    Show  the  mail  submission  queue   specified   in
              _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_i_l_/_s_u_b_m_i_t_._c_f instead of the MTA queue speci-
              fied in _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_i_l_/_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l_._c_f.

       --qq[_!]I substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r  as
              a substring of the queue id or not when _!  is spec-
              ified.

       --qq[_!]R substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r  as
              a  substring of one of the recipients or not when _!
              is specified.

       --qq[_!]S substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing _s_u_b_s_t_r  as
              a  substring of the sender or not when _!  is speci-
              fied.

       --vv     Print verbose information.  This adds the  priority
              of  the  message  and  a single character indicator
              (``+'' or blank) indicating whether a warning  mes-
              sage  has  been  sent on the first line of the mes-
              sage.  Additionally, extra lines may be  intermixed
              with  the  recipients  indicating the ``controlling
              user'' information; this shows  who  will  own  any

              programs  that  are executed on behalf of this mes-

              expanded  from,  if any.  Moreover, status messages
              for each recipient are printed if available.

       The mmaaiillqq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if  an  error
       occurs.
