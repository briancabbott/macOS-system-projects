    @discussion Defines the basic interface for Command DescriptorBlock (CDB) commands, which you use
    to control SCSI Architectural Model (SAM) devices, including ATAPI, Firewire SBP2, and SCSI devices.
        
    @field firstField Description of first field.
    @callback setPointers Specifies the location of the data buffer for an I/O command, 
    as well as the maximum data transfer count and data transfer direction.
    
    The setPointers function has the following parameters:
    @param cmd A pointer to the CDB command interface instance for the current command.
    You must always pass this reference.

    @param sgList A pointer to a scatter/gather list (scatter for reading, gather for writing)
    containing one or more records that specify the ranges of virtual memory in the command's
    I/O buffer. Each element in a scatter/gather list describes the location and size of one buffer,
    allowing you to group multiple buffers of any size into a single virtual buffer for an
    I/O transaction. You can pass NULL for this parameter (for a command that doesn't require
    a data buffer).
    
    @result An IOReturn structure which returns the return value in the structure returned.  

    @callback getPointers Gets the location of the data buffer for an I/O command. The buffer
    can be in one or more, possibly discontiguous, locations.
    
    The getPointers function has the following parameters:
    @param cmd A pointer to the CDB command interface instance for the current command.
    You must always pass this reference.

    @param outSGList A pointer to a pointer to a scatter/gather list (scatter for reading, gather for writing)
    containing one or more records that specify the ranges of virtual memory in the command's
    I/O buffer. Each element in a scatter/gather list describes the location and size of one buffer,
    allowing you to group multiple buffers of any size into a single virtual buffer for an
    I/O transaction. On return, the list specifies the I/O buffer for the command.

    @param outSGEntries On return, specifies the number of records in the scatter/gather list pointed to
    by the outSGList parameter.

    @param outTransferCount On return, the maximum data transfer count in bytes for the
    command.

    @param outIsWrite On return, specifies whether the command is a write command (true),
    or a read command (false)
