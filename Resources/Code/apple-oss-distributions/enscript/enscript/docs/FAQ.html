<b>For GNU Enscript version 1.6.0</b>
<p>

This FAQ assumes that you are using the latest version of GNU
Enscript, there are many old bugs and misfeatures but many of them
have been fixed for the latest version.  For on-line information about
the latest version, bugs, features, etc. please, check the GNU
Enscript WWW home at URL:

<h2>Misc</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Does enscript read PPD files?</b>
       <br>
       No.  PPD file support is on my TODO list, I will implement in the near
       future.
       <p>

  <li> <b>What's missing / what's different in the Adobe enscript
       emulation?</b>
       <ul>
	 <li>Enscript's option `-o' has been changed.  In enscript `-o' lists
	      missing characters.  In GNU enscript `-o' is an alias
	      for `-p' and missing characters are listed with an option `-O'.
       </ul>
  <li> <b>Make install installs with teh current umask. I use 077 for
    root, which gives all the installed directories rwx------. No good
    for general use...</b>
    <br>
    Makefile is just doing what it was told.  Change your umask for
    the installation time or override INSTALL_DATA and INSTALL_PROGRAM
    Makefile variables.

<h2>Character Sets</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>How can I use ibmpc's line drawing characters?</b>
       <p>
       First, you will need a PostScript font (.pfa or .pfb) which has
       those line drawing characters.  This is the trickiest task
       since these fonts are really rare.  Once you find one, you must
       make it available for enscript (see file README for details) so
       it can be downloaded to the printer.
       <p>
       Since these suitable fonts are so rare, the ibmpc encoding do not
       contain mappings for those line drawing characters, this means they
       won't print if you use the ibmpc encoding.  You must rely on the
       font's build-in encoding and print your files with option `-X ps' or
       `--encoding=ps'.
       <p>
  <li> <b>How can I use the ISO-8859-7 input encoding?</b>
       <p>
       Manolis Lourakis
       (<a href="mailto:lourakis@csd.uch.gr">lourakis@csd.uch.gr</a>)
       has written a document that describes how this can be done.  It
       can be found from URL:

       <blockquote>
       <a href="http://www.csd.uch.gr/~lourakis/genscript/">http://www.csd.uch.gr/~lourakis/genscript/</a>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
  <li> <b>I tried the iso8859/2 input encoding but enscript says that 44
       characters were missing and I get '?' on paper instead of latin2
       characters.  Did I missed something? (This answer holds also for
       other input encodings).</b>
       <p>
       No, everything is ok but the problem is that Adobe's default Courier
       font does not have characters named: Aogonek, Lcaron, Sacute, Tcaron,
       Zacute, ... (those 44 missing characters) so enscript can't print
       them.  You can solve this if you have a courier (or whatever) font
       that has those missing characters.  One good canditate is courier
       font distributed with the X distribution, it is called cour.pf{a,b}
       and should be found from all good FTP sites.
       <p>
       To solve this problem, you must:
       <ol>
	 <li> find a nice font to do the job.
	 <li> copy this font and its AFM file to some appropriate directory,
	      let's say `$HOME/fonts/':

<pre>
$ ls fonts/cour*
fonts/cour.afm  fonts/cour.pfa
</pre>

	 <li> create a font map for this new font directory (<b>mkafmmap</b>
	      program comes with the enscript distribution):

<pre>
$ cd fonts
$ mkafmmap *.afm
file=font.map
BrushScript.afm...
Hobo.afm...
Stencil.afm...
cour.afm...
uaqrrc.afm...
ugqb.afm...
unmr.afm...
unmrs.afm...
</pre>

	 <li> edit enscript's personal (or the global) configuration file to
	      use this new font:

<pre>
$ cat ~/.enscriptrc
#
# My enscript init file.
#

DefaultFancyHeader: emacs

#PageLabelFormat: long

Clean7Bit: 0

AFMPath: /home/mtr/fonts:/usr/local/share/enscript
</pre>

	 <li> now it should work:

<pre>
$ cd myprogs/enscript/
$ enscript -v -G2r -pfoo.ps latin2.txt
AFM: scanning path...
AFM: reading font map "/home/mtr/fonts/font.map"
AFM: reading font map "/usr/local/share/enscript/font.map"
reading AFM info for font "Courier"
processing file "latin2.txt"...
[ 3 pages * 1 copy ] left in foo.ps
</pre>
       </ol>
       Now enscript uses this new courier font that has those missing
       characters.  Since the font file `.pfa' is found from the font
       path, enscript automatically includes that font file to your
       PostScript output.  This means that it can be printed with any
       PostScript printer; now file really contains that font so it does
       not depend on printer's fonts.
       <p>
</ul>

<h2>Printing, Output Media</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>I printed some documents with options `-G2r', everything goes just
       fine but there are no page numbers in the upper right corner.  What
       goes wrong?</b>
  <br> You are probably using wrong output media; your printer uses
       different output media than enscript.  Check what is your default
       output media in the <b>enscript.cfg</b> (and <b>$HOME/.enscriptrc</b>)
       file and change it if needed.  For example, to change enscript's
       default media A4 to Letter, you must to do the following change:

<pre>
# Default output media.
DefaultMedia: A4
=>
DefaultMedia: Letter
</pre>

       You can also set the default output media during the
       configuration step, just give configure script option
       <p>

       <b>--with-media</b>[=<i>media</i>]
       <p>
       If no <i>media</i> is given, it defaults to <tt>Letter</tt>.
       <p>

  <li> <b>How can I change margins under enscript?</b>
  <br> You have to define a new output media which has better margins.
       This is quite easy, just define the new media in enscript's
       configuration file.  For example, below is a new `A4BigMargin'
       media with bigger margins:

<pre>
# Media definitions:
#	name		width	height	llx	lly	urx	ury
Media:	A3		839	1190	18	17	821	1173
Media:	A4		595	839	18	17	581	822
Media:	A5		420	595	18	17	406	578
Media:  Letter		612	792	18	17	597	776
Media:	Legal		612	1008	18	17	597	992

Media:   A4BigMargin	595	839	36	34	563	805
</pre>

       You can select this media by giving enscript option `-M A4BigMargin'
       or by setting it to be your default output media by editing
       <b>enscript.cfg</b>:

<pre>
# Default output media.
DefaultMedia: A4
=>
DefaultMedia: A4BigMargin
</pre>
       <p>

  <li> <b>Ghostscript does not show enscript's outputs correctly, what's the
       problem?</b>
  <br> There is one minor problem in enscript / ghostscript co-operation.
       Enscript's default output media is <b>A4</b> (because I live in
       Europe) and GhostScript's default output media is <b>Letter</b>.
       There are three solutions for this problem:<p>

       <ol>
	 <li> Tell Enscript that it should use the Letter media:
<pre>
$ enscript -MLetter <i>other options and files</i>
</pre>

	 <li> Fix Enscript<br>
	      Add / edit following line to file enscript.cfg:
<pre>
# Default output media.
DefaultMedia: A4

=>

# Default output media.
DefaultMedia: Letter
</pre>

	 <li> Fix GhostScript <br>
	      edit following line to file gs_init.ps:
<pre>
% Optionally choose a default paper size other than U.S. letter.
% (a4) /PAPERSIZE where { pop pop } { /PAPERSIZE exch def } ifelse

=>

% Optionally choose a default paper size other than U.S. letter.
(a4) /PAPERSIZE where { pop pop } { /PAPERSIZE exch def } ifelse
</pre>
	      or give ghostscript option <code>-sPAPERSIZE=a4</code>
       </ol>
 <p>
 <li> <b>My PostScript printer supports only level 1 PostScript.  How
 can I setup enscript to work with it?</b>
 <p>
 The level 2 features are protected by an if-else block in the
 generated output file.  So, basicly everything should work smoothly.
 But, there is a but.  As a default, enscript generates the page size
 selection code, and it might cause a syntax error on level 1
 PostScript engines.  This problem is fixed by disabling the page size
 generation.  Just edit your <strong>.enscriptrc</strong> or
 <strong>enscript.cfg</strong> files and add the following line:

<pre>
GeneratePageSize: 0
</pre>
