1998-06-23  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

	* afmparse.c (afm_parse_file): Added +1's to the memory
	allocations to avoid zero allocations.  There are some AFM files
	available that say, for example, "StartComposites 0".  That used
	to fail on some systems which memory allocation routines do not
	like zero allocations.

1998-06-11  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

	compilation problems from this library.

	* afm.c (afm_font_stringwidth): Fixed cast bug where char was cast
	to unsigned int.
	(afm_font_charwidth): Changed <ch> argument's type to `char' and
	changed the cast to `unsigned char'.

	`char'.

Wed Dec 20 08:39:24 1995  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

 	stdout.

Fri Oct 20 14:16:42 1995  Markku Rossi  <mtr@ngs.fi>

	* afmparse.c (read_character_metrics): some AFM files give too big
