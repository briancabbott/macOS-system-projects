# APPLE LOCAL: I switched the order of these breakpoints.  For some reason
# if the FIRST breakpoint succeeds, then you don't error out when the 
# second one fails.  libSystem got an internal_error function in
# SnowLeopard, so this was going all the way through in the target 
# program.  Note, this is in general a REALLY hacky way to make the
# .gdbinit work only for the gdb you're debugging, and not the inferior.
