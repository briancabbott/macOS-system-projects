   --  This should be called at the end of every compiler interface
   --  procedure that implements an entry call.
   --  In principle, the caller should not be abort-deferred (unless
   --  the application program violates the Ada language rules by doing
   --  entry calls from within protected operations -- an erroneous practice
   --  apparently followed with success by some adventurous GNAT users).
   --  Absolutely, the caller should not be holding any locks, or there
   --  will be deadlock.
