>A POSIX conforming test framework</A
></H1
><P
>DejaGnu conforms to the POSIX 1003.3 standard for test
      frameworks. I was also a member of that committe.</P
><P
>The POSIX standard 1003.3 defines what a testing framework needs to
      provide, in order to permit the creation of POSIX conformance test
      suites. This standard is primarily oriented to running POSIX conformance
      tests, but its requirements also support testing of features not related
      to POSIX conformance.  POSIX 1003.3 does not specify a particular testing
      framework, but at this time there is only one other POSIX conforming test
      framework: TET. TET was created by Unisoft for a consortium comprised of
      X/Open, Unix International, and the Open Software Foundation.</P
><P
>The POSIX documentation refers to <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>assertions</I
>.
      An assertion is a description of behavior.  For example, if a standard
      says ``The sun shall shine'', a corresponding assertion might be ``The
      sun is shining.''  A test based on this assertion would pass or fail
      depending on whether it is daytime or nighttime.  It is important to note
      that the standard being tested is never 1003.3; the standard being tested
      is some other standard, for which the assertions were written.</P
><P
>As there is no test suite to test testing frameworks for POSIX
      1003.3 conformance, verifying conformance to this standard is done by
      repeatedly reading the standard and experimenting.  One of the main
      things 1003.3 does specify is the set of allowed output messages, and
      their definitions.  Four messages are supported for a required feature of
      POSIX conforming systems, and a fifth for a conditional feature. DejaGnu
      supports the use of all five output messages; in this sense a test suite
      that uses exactly these messages can be considered POSIX conforming.
      These definitions specify the output of a test
      case:</P

><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"

>PASS</DT
><DD
><P
>A test has succeeded.  That is, it demonstrated that
	  the assertion is true.</P
></DD
><DT
>XFAIL</DT
><DD
><P
>POSIX 1003.3 does not incorporate the notion of
	  expected failures, so <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>PASS</I
>, instead of
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>XPASS</I
>, must also be returned for test cases
	  which were expected to fail and did not.  This means that
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>PASS</I
> is in some sense more ambiguous than if
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>XPASS</I
> is also used.</P
></DD
><DT
>FAIL</DT
><DD
><P
>A test has produced the bug it was intended to
	  capture.  That is, it has demonstrated that the assertion is false.
	  The <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>FAIL</I
> message is based on the test case only.
	  Other messages are used to indicate a failure of the framework. As
	  with <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>PASS</I
>, POSIX tests must return
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>FAIL</I
> rather than <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>XFAIL</I
> even
	  if a failure was expected.</P
></DD

>UNRESOLVED</DT

><P
>A test produced indeterminate results.  Usually, this
	  means the test executed in an unexpected fashion; this outcome
	  requires that a human being go over results, to determine if the test
	  should have passed or failed.  This message is also used for any test
	  that requires human intervention because it is beyond the abilities
	  of the testing framework.  Any unresolved test should resolved to
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>PASS</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>FAIL</I
> before a test
	  run can be considered finished.</P
><P
>Note that for POSIX, each assertion must produce a test result
	  code.  If the test isn't actually run, it must produce
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>UNRESOLVED</I
> rather than just leaving that test
	  out of the output.  This means that you have to be careful when
	  writing tests, to not carelessly use tcl statements like
	  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>return</I
>---if you alter the flow of control of the
	  tcl code you must insure that every test still produces some result
	  code.</P

> from DejaGnu while processing
	    the test, or because there were three or more
	    <I

	    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>WARNING</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

	    messages can invalidate the output of the test.  This

>There is no support for the tested case.  This may

  	    compiler, is not implemented.  DejaGnu also uses this message when
  	    a testing environment (often a ``bare board'' target) lacks basic
  	    support for compiling or running the test case.  For example, a
  	    test for the system subroutine <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>gethostname</I

  	    would never work on a target board running only a boot
  	    monitor.</P

>DejaGnu uses the same output procedures to produce these messages

	you must avoid the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>setup</I
>xfail} procedure as
	described in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
