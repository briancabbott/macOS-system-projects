.SH DESCRIPTION
.B PHP
is a widely\-used general\-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for 
Web development and can be embedded into HTML. This is the command line interface
that enables you to do the following:
.P
You can parse and execute files by using parameter \-f followed by the name of the 
.IR file 
to be executed.
.LP
Using parameter \-r you can directly execute PHP 
.IR code 
simply as you would do inside a .php file when using the 
.B eval() 
function.
.LP
If none of \-r or \-f is present but a single parameter is given 
then this parameter is taken as the filename to parse and execute (same as 
with \-f). If no parameter is present then the standard input is read and 
executed.

.B php\-cli.ini
The configuration file for the CLI version of PHP.
.TP
.B php.ini
The standard configuration file will only be used when 
.B php\-cli.ini
cannot not be found.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 5
\fIphp -r 'echo "Hello World\\n";'\fP
This command simply writes the text "Hello World" to standard out.
.TP
\fIphp \-r 'print_r(gd_info());'\fP
This shows the configuration of your gd extension. You can use this
to easily check which imag formats you can use. If you have any
dynamic modules you may want to use the same ini file that php uses
when executed from your webserver. There are more extensions which
have such a function. For dba use:
.RS
\fIphp \-r 'print_r(dba_handlers(1));'\fP
.RE
.SH TIPS
You can use a shebang line to automatically invoke php
from scripts. Only the CLI version of PHP will ignore
such a first line as shown below:
.P
.PD 0
.RS
#!/bin/php
.P
<?php
.P
 // your script
.P
?>
