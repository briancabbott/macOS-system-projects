To Do List

This informal list is the working list for the php sablotron extension.  It is
maintained and used by the people on sab-php@gingerall.cz.  See 
http://www.gingerall.org/charlie/ga/xml/m_ml.xml for more information.

The numbering of the items on the list does not imply priority.  Rather it is
simply a means for efficient communication on the mailing lists.
