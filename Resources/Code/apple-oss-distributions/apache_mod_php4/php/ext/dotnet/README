Warning
=======

This support is EXPERIMENTAL.  In fact, it integrates code that
Microsoft labels as pre-beta.  Use at your own risk.

Build instructions
==================

Download and install the .NET Framework SDK Technology Preview from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/#sdk.  Once installed, copy Mscoree.h 
(typically found in C:\Program Files\NGWSSDK\Include to ext\dotnet).  
Do not simply add the NGWSSDK\Include directory to the include path 
as this will cause compilation failures.

Download and unzip the source to the dm.net COM Moniker from 
http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/clr/readme.htm.  Copy mscorlib.h
to ext\dotnet.  There is no need to register the clrmonsrv.dll as 
it is not used.

At this point, the dotnet project can be built like any other
project, from either VisualStudio 6's GUI or from the command line.
Example command line invocation:

  msdev dotnet.dsp /MAKE "dotnet - Win32 Debug_TS"

Execution instructions:
=======================

Add "extension=php_dotnet.dll" into php.ini.

Sample program can be found at dotnet.php
