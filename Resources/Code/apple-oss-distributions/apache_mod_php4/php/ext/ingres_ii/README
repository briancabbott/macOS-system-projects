Ingres II extension for PHP 4.0
===============================

This extension provides access to Ingres II servers from PHP 4.0.
It is still in development and has been only quickly tested on
Linux (Mandrake 5.3 for Intel), so you should avoid using it with
critical data.

To enable the extension just add --with-ingres to your ./configure
line. If the Ingres files are not found, use --with-ingres=DIR instead
to specify your Ingres installation directory.

Please report suggestions to henot@php.net.
