/*
   This is the ``Mersenne Twister'' random number generator MT19937, which
   generates pseudorandom integers uniformly distributed in 0..(2^32 - 1)
   starting from any odd seed in 0..(2^32 - 1).  This version is a recode
   by Shawn Cokus (Cokus@math.washington.edu) on March 8, 1998 of a version by
   Takuji Nishimura (who had suggestions from Topher Cooper and Marc Rieffel in
   July-August 1997).
  
   Effectiveness of the recoding (on Goedel2.math.washington.edu, a DEC Alpha
   running OSF/1) using GCC -O3 as a compiler: before recoding: 51.6 sec. to
   generate 300 million random numbers; after recoding: 24.0 sec. for the same
   (i.e., 46.5% of original time), so speed is now about 12.5 million random
   number generations per second on this machine.
  
   According to the URL <http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html>
   (and paraphrasing a bit in places), the Mersenne Twister is ``designed
   with consideration of the flaws of various existing generators,'' has
   a period of 2^19937 - 1, gives a sequence that is 623-dimensionally
   equidistributed, and ``has passed many stringent tests, including the
   die-hard test of G. Marsaglia and the load test of P. Hellekalek and
   S. Wegenkittl.''  It is efficient in memory usage (typically using 2506
   to 5012 bytes of static data, depending on data type sizes, and the code
   is quite short as well).  It generates random numbers in batches of 624
   at a time, so the caching and pipelining of modern systems is exploited.
   It is also divide- and mod-free.

   php_uint32 must be an unsigned integer type capable of holding at least 32
   bits; exactly 32 should be fastest, but 64 is better on an Alpha with
   GCC at -O3 optimization so try your options and see what's best for you

   Melo: we should put some ifdefs here to catch those alphas...

	   We initialize state[0..(N-1)] via the generator

	     x_new = (69069 * x_old) mod 2^32

	   from Line 15 of Table 1, p. 106, Sec. 3.3.4 of Knuth's
	   _The Art of Computer Programming_, Volume 2, 3rd ed.

	   Notes (SJC): I do not know what the initial state requirements
	   of the Mersenne Twister are, but it seems this seeding generator
	   could be better.  It achieves the maximum period for its modulus
	   (2^30) iff x_initial is odd (p. 20-21, Sec. 3.2.1.2, Knuth); if
	   x_initial can be even, you have sequences like 0, 0, 0, ...;
	   2^31, 2^31, 2^31, ...; 2^30, 2^30, 2^30, ...; 2^29, 2^29 + 2^31,
	   2^29, 2^29 + 2^31, ..., etc. so I force seed to be odd below.

	   
	   Even if x_initial is odd, if x_initial is 1 mod 4 then

	     the          lowest bit of x is always 1,
	     the  next-to-lowest bit of x is always 0,
	     the 2nd-from-lowest bit of x alternates      ... 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... ,
	     the 3rd-from-lowest bit of x 4-cycles        ... 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 ... ,
	     the 4th-from-lowest bit of x has the 8-cycle ... 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 ... ,
	      ...

	   and if x_initial is 3 mod 4 then

	     the          lowest bit of x is always 1,
	     the  next-to-lowest bit of x is always 1,
	     the 2nd-from-lowest bit of x alternates      ... 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ... ,
	     the 3rd-from-lowest bit of x 4-cycles        ... 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 ... ,
	     the 4th-from-lowest bit of x has the 8-cycle ... 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 ... ,
	      ...

	   The generator's potency (min. s>=0 with (69069-1)^s = 0 mod 2^32) is
	   16, which seems to be alright by p. 25, Sec. 3.2.1.3 of Knuth.  It
	   also does well in the dimension 2..5 spectral tests, but it could be
	   better in dimension 6 (Line 15, Table 1, p. 106, Sec. 3.3.4, Knuth).

	   Note that the random number user does not see the values generated
	   here directly since reloadMT() will always munge them first, so maybe
	   none of all of this matters.  In fact, the seed values made here could
	   even be extra-special desirable if the Mersenne Twister theory says
	   so-- that's why the only change I made is to restrict to odd seeds.

/*
 * A bit of tricky math here.  We want to avoid using a modulus because
 * that simply tosses the high-order bits and might skew the distribution
 * of random values over the range.  Instead we map the range directly.
 *
 * We need to map the range from 0...M evenly to the range a...b
 * Let n = the random number and n' = the mapped random number
 *
 * Then we have: n' = a + n(b-a)/M
 *
 * We have a problem here in that only n==M will get mapped to b which
 # means the chances of getting b is much much less than getting any of
 # the other values in the range.  We can fix this by increasing our range
 # artifically and using:
 #
 #               n' = a + n(b-a+1)/M
 *
 # Now we only have a problem if n==M which would cause us to produce a
 # number of b+1 which would be bad.  So we bump M up by one to make sure
 # this will never happen, and the final algorithm looks like this:
 #
 #               n' = a + n(b-a+1)/(M+1)
