If you downloaded this separately, you can place the dbx folder 
in the php-source-folders under the ext/ folder. Be sure to 
use buildconf to rebuild the configure script.

Linux:

Compile php with the --enable-dbx switch

Windows:

This should set all includepaths to the right 
relative folders. Open the .dsp and compile. You could also
add this project to the php_modules project.
It generates a php_dbx.dll in your extensions folder, and you
must enable it in your php.ini file.


When you run phpinfo(), dbx-support should be visible in the
resulting table.

Good luck and enjoy!
