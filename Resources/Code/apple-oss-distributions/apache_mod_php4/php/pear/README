WHAT IS PEAR?

PEAR is a code repository for PHP extensions and PHP library code
similar to TeX's CTAN and Perl's CPAN.

The intention behind PEAR is to provide a means for library code
authors to organize their code in a defined way shared by other
developers, and to give the PHP community a single source for such
code.
