/**
 * @up:		pointer to index context located directly above in the tree
 * @down:	pointer to index context located directly below in the tree
 * @idx_ni:	inode containing the @entry described by this context
 * @base_ni:	base inode
 * @entry:	if @is_locked this is the index entry (points into @ir or @ia)
 * @is_root:	1 if @entry is in @ir and 0 if it is in @ia
 * @ir:		index root if @is_root and @is_locked and NULL otherwise
 * @actx:	attribute search context if @is_root and @is_locked or NULL
 * @ia:		index block if @is_root is 0 and @is_locked or NULL
 * @upl_ofs:	byte offset into the index allocation at which @upl begins
 * @upl:	page list if @is_root is 0 and @is_locked or NULL
 * @pl:		array of pages containing the page itself if @is_root is 0
 * @addr:	mapped address of the page data if @is_root is 0 and @is_locked
 *
 * @up and @down are pointers used to chain the various index contexts together
 * into a path through the B+tree index.  This path is used to describe the
 * index nodes traversed during a lookup.
 *
 * @up points to the index context that is immediately above in the tree or if
 * this is the top of the tree then @up is the bottom of the tree.
 *
 * @down points to the index context that is immediately below in the tree or
 * if this is the bottom of the tree then @down is the top of the tree.
 *
 * If this index context is the only node then @up == @down == this index
 * context.
 *
 * @idx_ni is the index inode this context belongs to and @base_ni is the base
 * inode to which @idx_ni belongs.
 *
 * @entry is the index entry described by this context.  It is only valid when
 * @is_locked is true.
 *
 * If @is_rootis 1, @entry is in the index root attribute @ir described by the
 * attribute search context @actx and the base inode @base_ni.  @ia, @upl, @pl,
 * and @addr do not exist in this case as they are in a union with @ir and
 * @actx.
 *
 * If @is_root is 0, @entry is in the index allocation attribute and @ia,
 * @upl_ofs, @upl, @pl, and @addr point to the index allocation block and the
 * mapped, locked page it is in, respectively.  @ir and @actx do not exist in
 * this case.  Note @upl_ofs is the byte offset inside the index allocation
 * attribute at which the page list @upl begins.  This is used when an index
 * context is relocked/remapped to determine if it now is at a different
 * virtual memory address and thus all pointers in the index context need to be
 * updated for the new page address @addr.
 *
 * To obtain a context call ntfs_index_ctx_get().
 *
 * We use this context to allow ntfs_index_lookup() to return the found index
 * @entry without having to allocate a buffer and copy the @entry and/or its
 * data into it.
 *
 * When finished with the @entry and its data, call ntfs_index_ctx_put() to
 * free the context and other associated resources.
 *
 * If the index entry was modified, call ntfs_index_entry_mark_dirty() before
 * the call to ntfs_index_ctx_put() to ensure that the changes are written to
 * disk.
