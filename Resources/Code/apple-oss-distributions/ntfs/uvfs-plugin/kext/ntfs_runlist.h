 *
 * The last vcn (in fact the last vcn + 1) is reached when length == 0.

 * physically allocated (i.e. this is a hole / data is sparse).

/**
 * ntfs_runlist - in memory vcn to lcn mapping array including a read/write lock
 * @rl:		pointer to an array of runlist elements
 * @elements:	number of runlist elements in runlist
 * @alloc:	number of bytes allocated for this runlist in memory
 * @lock:	read/write lock for serializing access to @rl
 *
 * This is the runlist structure.  It describes the mapping from file offsets
 * (described as virtual cluster numbers (VCNs)) to on-disk offsets (described
 * as logical cluster numbers (LCNs)).
 *
 * The runlist is made up of an array of runlist elements where each element
 * contains the VCN at which that run starts, the corresponding physical
 * location, i.e. the LCN, at which that run starts and the length in clusters
 * of this run.
 *
 * When doing lookups in the runlist it must be locked for either reading or
 * writing.
 *
 * When modifying the runlist in memory it must be locked for writing.
 *
 * Note that the complete runlist can be spread out over several NTFS
 * attribute fragments in which case only one or only a few parts of the
 * runlist may be mapped at any point in  time.  In this case the regions that
 * are not mapped have placeholders with an LCN of LCN_RL_NOT_MAPPED.  In this
 * case a lookup can lead to a readlocked runlist being writelocked because the
 * in-memory runlist will need updating with the mapped in runlist fragment.
 *
 * Another special value is LCN_HOLE which means that the clusters are not
 * allocated on disk, i.e. this run is sparse, i.e. it is a hole on the
 * attribute.  Thus on reading you just need to interpret the whole run as
 * containing zeroes and on writing you need to allocate real clusters and then
 * write to them.
 *
 * For other special values of LCNs please see below, where the enum
 * LCN_SPECIAL_VALUES is defined.
