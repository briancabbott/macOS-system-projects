.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Squatter
creates a new SQUAT index for one or more IMAP mailboxes.  The SQUAT
index is a unified index of all of the header and body text of each
message a given mailbox.  This index is used to significantly reduce
IMAP SEARCH times on a mailbox.
.PP
.I Squatter
creates an index of ALL messages in the mailbox, not just those since
the last time that it was run (i.e., it does NOT do incremental
updates).  Any messages appended to the mailbox after
.I squatter
is run, will NOT be included in the index.  To include new messages in
the index,
.I squatter
must be run again.
For large and active mailboxes, it is recommended to run
.I squatter
periodically as an EVENT in
.IR cyrus.conf (5)
.
.PP
.B NOTE:
Messages and mailboxes that have not been indexed CAN still be
SEARCHed, just not as quickly as those with a SQUAT index.
.PP
.I Squatter
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-C " config-file"
Read configuration options from \fIconfig-file\fR.
.TP
.B \-r
Recursively create indexes for all sub-mailboxes of the mailboxes or
mailbox prefixes given as arguments.
.TP
.B \-s
Skip mailboxes whose index file is older than their current squat file
(within a small time delta).
.TP
.B \-a
Only create indexes for mailboxes which have the shared
\fI/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat\fR annotation set to "true".
.br
.sp
The value of the \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat\fR annotation is
inherited by all children of the given mailbox, so an entire mailbox
tree can be indexed (or not indexed) by setting a single annotation on
the root of that tree with a value of "true" (or "false").  If a
mailbox does not have a \fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat\fR annotation
set on it (or does not inherit one), then the mailbox is not indexed.
In other words, the implicit value of
\fB/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat\fR is "false".
.TP
.B \-v
Increase the verbosity of progress/status messages.
