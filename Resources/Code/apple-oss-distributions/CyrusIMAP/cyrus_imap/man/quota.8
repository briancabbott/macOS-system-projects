.SH NAME
quota \- report and optionally fix quota usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B quota
[
.B \-C
.I config-file
]
[
.B \-d
.I domain
]
[
.B \-f
]
[
.IR mailbox-prefix ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Quota
generates a report listing quota roots, giving their limits and usage.
If the
.I \-f
option is given, 
.I quota
first fixes any inconsistencies in the quota subsystem, such as
mailboxes with the wrong quota root or quota roots with the wrong
quota usage reported.
If an optional
.I domain
is given, the quota listing (and inconsistency fixing) is performed in
that domain rather than the default domain.
If any optional
.I mailbox-prefix
arguments are given, the quota listing (and inconsistency fixing) is
limited to quota roots with names that start with one of the given
prefixes.
.PP
Running
.I quota
with both the 
.I \-f
option and
.I mailbox-prefix
arguments is not recommended.
.PP
.I Quota
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file unless specified otherwise by \fB-C\fR.
