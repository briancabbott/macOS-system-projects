\fB/etc/krb.equiv\fR \- Kerberos equivalences
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb.equiv
contains zero or more lines, each of which describes a mapping of a kerberos
principal (\fIuserid@host\fR) to a local user (\fIuserid\fR or alias).  
Each line of the file consists of two fields,
separated by at least one whitespace character; other blanks are
ignored.  The first field is the kerberos principal name to
remap, and the second is the name of the corresponding local user.
