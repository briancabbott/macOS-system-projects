# I intended this to be a subclass of Cyrus::IMAP, but that's a scalar ref so
# there's nowhere to hang the error information.  Indexing a "private" hash
# with the scalar sucks fully as much IMHO.  So we forward the Cyrus::IMAP
# methods on demand.

# yes, this is ugly.  but the overhead is minimized this way.

=head1 NAME

Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP - Perl module for Cyrus IMSP user options

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP;

  my $client = Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP->new('imsphost'[, $port[, $flags]]);
  $rc = $client->set('mailreader.window.size', '200x300');
  %options = $client->get('mailreader.*')
  $rc = $client->unset('mailreader.window.size');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a Perl interface to the Cyrus IMSP functions that
relate to user options (preferences). Only three IMSP operations are
implemented: set, unset, and get.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new($server[, $port[, $flags]])

Instantiates a B<Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP> object.  This is in fact a Cyrus::IMAP
object with a few additional methods, so all Cyrus::IMAP methods are
available if needed.  (In particular, you will always want to use the
C<authenticate> method.)

=item error

Return the last error that occurred, or undef if the last operation was
successful.  This is in some cases (such as C<get>) the only way to
distinguish between a successful return of an empty list and an error return.

Calling C<error> does not reset the error state, so it is legal to write:

    %options = $client->get($option);
    print STDERR "Error: ", $client->error if $client->error;

=item set($option, $value)

Sets the option named by $option to the value in $value.

There are no restrictions or quoting rules needed to protect special
characters in the value argument. (The Cyrus::IMAP layer will take care
those details by adding double quotes or a literal introducer.)

If successful, returns 1. Otherwise, returns undef and makes an error
message available through the "error" function.

=item unset($option)

Removes the option named by $option. The option is completely removed
from the user's name space but will revert to a site-wide default if
one has been set. Note that this is different from assigning an option
the null value with set($option, '').

If you try to unset an option that does not exist, an error is
returned saying that the option was already unset.

If successful, returns 1. Otherwise, returns undef and makes an error
message available through the "error" function.

=item get($option_pattern)

Get takes either an option name or a pattern of names to fetch. The
pattern can contain either "*" or "%" wildcards anywhere in the
string. The usual IMAP wildcard semantics apply.

The return value is a hash of options with each key being an option
name and each value being the option's value string. If an empty hash
is returned, it's either because there were no matching options or
because some error happened. Check the "error" function to see which
was the case.

The IMSP protocol also returns an access flag of "[READ-WRITE]" or
"[READ-ONLY]" but that information is discarded by this function. A
more complicated function that returns both the value and the access
flag could be added later if needed.
