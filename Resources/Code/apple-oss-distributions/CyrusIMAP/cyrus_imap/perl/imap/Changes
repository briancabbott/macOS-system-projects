Revision history for Perl extension IMAP::Cyrus.

0.01  Mon Oct 18 11:24:14 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

0.06  Fri Oct 29 13:45:46 1999
	- imclient part complete, except for Perl wrapper for _send()

0.85  Thu Nov  4 16:24:13 1999
	- Perl wrapper for _authenticate(), does CAPABILITY call and works
	  around SASL bug
	- wrapper for _send complete; doesn't handle sync literals, because
	  that requires imclient internals visible from Perl
	- updated to Cyrus 1.6.19
	- added &getselectinfo()
	- tests are more comprehensive, no longer dependent on ECE

0.86  Fri Nov 12 16:22:17 1999
	- (partially) implemented IMAP::Cyrus::Shell
	- split IMAP::Cyrus and IMAP::Cyrus::Admin

0.95  Thu Dec 16 14:30:32 1999
	- rewrite IMAP::Cyrus::Admin error handling to use an error method
	  instead of stealing $@; this also allows checking for errors when
	  routines can legitimately return undef/()
	- wrapping it up, finalizing documentation, shell wrapper for cyradm
