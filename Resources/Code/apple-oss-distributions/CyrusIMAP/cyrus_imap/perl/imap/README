This is a Perl interface to the Cyrus imclient library, and an administrative
library, and a replacement for the "cyradm" shell.  The imclient library is
used (instead of using existing IMAP modules) because it supports SASL, which
appears to be required for administrative connections to Cyrus 1.6.x.

To build:

	[export CYRUS_SRC=/path/to/cyrus-imapd-source-dir]
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test	# or see below
	make install

"make test" is supposed to test the imclient (IMAP::Cyrus) and perform very
limited testing of Cyrus::IMAP::Admin.  Full testing cannot be done because
it requires a test account on the IMAP server and the tester to have an admin
credential.  (Unfortunately, SASL prompts for input via stdout and the test
harness eats stdout, so you can only run the tests by hand.  Sigh.)

For more complete testing, you may run it in interactive mode:

	perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib -MIMAP::Cyrus::Shell \
		-e shell [-- --user adminname] [server]

cyradm.sh does this (and will be installed as "cyradm"), but it expects
IMAP::Cyrus to already be installed.

For more information, perldoc is your friend:

	perldoc Cyrus::IMAP		# imclient library
	perldoc Cyrus::IMAP::Admin	# administrative library
	perldoc Cyrus::IMAP::Shell	# cyradm shell
	man cyradm			# the same
