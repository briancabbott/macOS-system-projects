cyrus-graphtools v1.0

Please send all comments/questions/bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.

--------

This archive contains the scripts necessary for collecting data from
CMU cyrus server with UCD SNMP support.  It contains:

script/cyrus.pl - script for retrieving data from the server and
		  dumping it into an rrdtool database
script/cyrusrc  - configuration options for rrdtool database
script/run      - a shell script to automatically run cyrus.pl every
                  4 minutes.  Due to rrdtool eccentricities, a cron
                  job that runs every 5 minutes is not sufficient.

cgi-bin/cyrus_master.pl	   - a cgi script that determines what rrdtool
			     are available and provides links to them
cgi-bin/graph_cyrus_db.pl  - a cgi script that graphs the rrdtool db
			     passed to it

html/index.html		   - sample html script that links to
			     cyrus_master.pl and graph_cyrus_db-sum.pl

--------

cyrus-graphtools requires that you have rrdtool version 1.0.28 or
better installed.  It may work with other 1.0+ versions, but I have
not tested it.  It is available here:
http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/pub  


Also required is net-snmp 4.2 (formerly ucd-snmp), however this is
required for the cyrus snmp functionality as well.  It is available at
http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/

or maybe
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12694

Data collection:

For data collection you must create a program directory and a data
directory.  The scripts assume /data/prog/cyrus and /data/cyrus,
respectively.  This can be changed by editing script/cyrusrc.

Move the contents of script/ to your data directory and run "run" and
your data is being collected.

-------

Web Display:

Web graphing also assumes that data is in /data/cyrus, so if this is
different, edit $DDIR in all three cgi scripts.

In addition, it assumes that apache document root is /usr/www/tree and
there is a directory called current/tainted that the "nobody" user (or
whatever uid httpd runs as) can write to.  $picdir and $hpicdir store
the internal and external names for these directories.

Copy the cgi-bin's into your cgi-bin directory and the html into your
html directory and you should be ready to go.
