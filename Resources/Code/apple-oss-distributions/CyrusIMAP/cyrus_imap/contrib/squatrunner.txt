The included patch sounds interesting, but I guess I'll wait until it is 
incorporated into the standard distribution.

Anyway, we have come up with a different idea regarding squatter. I am 
attaching a Perl script we are using in lieu of an entry in 
/etc/cyrus.conf. It is invoked and halted by the following crontab entry 
for the cyrus user:

0  0-23/4  *  *  *  /usr/libexec/cyrus/squatrunner.pl >> 
/var/lib/imap/squatter.log 2>&1
0  1-23/4  *  *  *  /bin/touch /var/lib/imap/squat.stop > /dev/null 2>&1

It's been working very nicely for us, allowing us to start and stop 
squatter whenever we want without having to start at the beginning.

Cheers, Sebastian Hagedorn
