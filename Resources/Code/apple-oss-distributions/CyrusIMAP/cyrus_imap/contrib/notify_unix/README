This directory contains two simple examples of UNIX notification daemons
written in Perl.  Both daemons require installing the
Net::Server::Prefork module, located in this directory.

The Perl script 'simple_notify.pl' simply logs mail notifications--it
shows the simplest possible handler.

The Perl script 'mysql_notify.pl' also logs the notification, but in
addition it looks up the username in a DB table in order to get additional
information about the user. This could be used, for example, to get a
user's instant messaging address from a database in order to send a
notification message.  'mysql_notify.pl' requires a file /etc/notify
that contains three lines: the DSN, username, and password to connect
to the database.

The shell script 'notify' is a sample init.d script for
starting/stopping the perl daemon.
