Sending Feedback on the Cyrus IMAP Server

    Feedback on and fixes for the software or on the document may be sent
    to cyrus-bugs+@andrew.cmu.edu. Unfortunately, we can not guarantee a
    response but we'll try the best we can. As usual, a high quality and
    complete message helps us tremendously. 

    If you submit a patch, please send unified diffs (-u) if your diff
    program supports them, or context diffs (-c) if it doesn't. Plain diffs
    are very difficult to evaluate. GNU diff can do this. 

    When reporting problems, be sure to include the relevant information.
    For example, you must include: 

      * the version of imapd 
      * the version of libsasl 
      * your system type (uname -a often provides the right information. 

    You should also include: 

      * the options you passed to ./configure 
      * the errors from make (if any) 
      * the config.status file generated by configure 

    NOTE: If you are able to connect to the imap server, all of this
    information can be gathered by using the version command in cyradm. If
    you can not use cyradm because you are having perl problems, you can
    connect using imtest and then run the following IMAP command: 

        a ID NIL 

    The info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu mailing list exists for the discussion of
    this server and other Cyrus software; more information is available in
    the mailing-list document. You may get faster/more responses by posting
    to this list instead of to cyrus-bugs, as there are more readers here.
