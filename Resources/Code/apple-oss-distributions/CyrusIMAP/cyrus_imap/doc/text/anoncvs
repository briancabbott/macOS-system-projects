Cyrus IMAP: Anonymous CVS Access

    This file is for those who are reading Cyrus sources via anonymous CVS,
    or those who would like to. If you're someone who would like to work
    with the source code and get more frequent updates, keeping in mind
    that we take some liberties with proper CVS use, you might want to get
    Cyrus via anonymous CVS. 

        If you're not a programmer, please don't do this. If you're not at
        least a little experienced with C, configure, and IMAP, please
        stick with the tarball releases at
        ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/. 

    To get to the repository, get a version of CVS with client-server
    support (anything remotely recent has this, I think) and do this: 

    cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.andrew.cmu.edu:/cvs login 
    (enter "anonymous" as the password) 
    cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.andrew.cmu.edu:/cvs co -d cyrus-imapd cyrus
    (the first -d specifies the CVSROOT, in this case, our CVS server, and
    a path to the CVS repository; co says "check out", -d says "and stick
    it in the directory cyrus-imapd", and "cyrus" specifies the "cyrus"
    collection). The password is "anonymous". 

    You will need autoconf (v2.12) to build CVS from the repository because
    we don't keep the configure script in the repository, along with the
    usual tools to build Cyrus (a compiler, a Unix box, a network.) 

    Read access to the repository is availible to anyone via
    cvs.andrew.cmu.edu. Write access is availible to only a few people at
    CMU. 

    Please note that the version in the repository is not the version we
    are running. We have a seperate system that resembles version control
    for releases of software on the Andrew system, and sometimes changes
    don't get propigated back to CVS. 

    What is here is supposed to be stable. It's supposed to work, and
    compile, and not have amazingly broken changes that can't possibly
    work. But that may not be the case--and since you decided to use CVS,
    you shouldn't complain when something doesn't work. You should submit a
    patch. 

    There is no warranty on the Cyrus software. There is no warranty on
    anything in CVS, and even less of a guarantee of it working. (There.
    You've been warned.) 

    Please refer to Sending Feedback if you would like to submit a bug,
    feature request or (best of all) patch. 

    Thanks to Ryan Troll for putting the time in to make the CVS server
    work and actually documenting it.
