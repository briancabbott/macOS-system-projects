Installing and configuring the IMAP Server

    This section describes the shell scripts to run and the configuration
    files to modify once "configure" and "make" have run. 

     1. Create a user and group for the Cyrus subsystem. The examples in
        this document assume a user of "cyrus" and a group of "mail",
        though any user and group name can be used. If a user other than
        "cyrus" is to be used, it must have been previously specified in
        the "--with-cyrus-user=" option to "configure". If a group other
        than "mail" is to be used, it must have been previously specified
        in the "--with-cyrus-group=" option to "configure". 

     2. After you've logged in as "root", install the cyrus software. 

           make install

        Be sure that the server programs ended up in the directory
        specified by "--with-cyrus-prefix" (by default, "/usr/cyrus/bin"). 

     3. The Cyrus IMAP server uses the 4.3BSD syslog that separates
        messages into both levels and categories. Invoke "man syslog" to
        see if "openlog()" takes three arguments. If it does not, replace
        the system "syslogd" and "syslog.conf" with the files provided in
        the "syslog" directory. 

           mv syslogd /etc/syslogd
           mv syslog.conf /etc/syslog.conf

        If you do not copy the "syslog/syslog.conf" file to the "/etc"
        directory, be sure to add support for "local6.debug". The file
        should include a line like: 

           local6.debug  /var/log/imapd.log

        You probably also want to log SASL messages with a line like: 

           auth.debug /var/log/auth.log

        After installation and testing, you probably want to change the
        ".debug" component to something a little less verbose. Create the
        log files: 

           touch /var/log/imapd.log /var/log/auth.log

     4. Create the file "/etc/imapd.conf". Here is a sample "imapd.conf"
        with a minimal number of values defined: 

           configdirectory: /var/imap
           partition-default: /var/spool/imap
           admins: curtj abell
           sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd

        For a description of all the fields in this file, see the
        imapd.conf(5) man page. (Note that this file also exports values to
        libsasl, the most important of them the pwcheck_method. In this
        example, users are authenticated via the saslauthd daemon, which
        can be run in a number of different ways.) 

        READ THE imapd.conf(5) MAN PAGE. There are options in there that
        you will want to know about and default behavior that you may not
        like. 

        Note that everyday users should not be administrators. Admins have
        powers not granted to regular users and while the server allows
        them to receive mail, some problems will occur if admins are used
        as regular users. You also should not read mail as an
        administrator. You should have separate accounts for reading mail
        and administrating. This is especially true if using the
        altnamespace option, because admins are always presented with the
        standard (internal) namespace. 

     5. Create the configuration directory specified by the
        "configdirectory" option in "imapd.conf." The configuration
        directory is similar in concept to the "/usr/lib/news" directory.
        It stores information about the IMAP server as a whole. 

        This document uses the configuration directory "/var/imap" in its
        examples. This directory should be owned by the cyrus user and
        group and should not permit access to other users. 

           cd /var
           mkdir imap
           chown cyrus imap
           chgrp mail imap
           chmod 750 imap

     6. Create the default partition directories specified in the
        "/etc/imapd.conf" file. 

        This document uses a default partition directory of
        "/var/spool/imap" in the following example: 

           cd /var/spool
           mkdir imap
           chown cyrus imap
           chgrp mail imap
           chmod 750 imap

        The partition directory is similar in concept to /var/spool/news.
        It is where the mailboxes are stored. Unlike most netnews systems,
        Cyrus allows you to have more than one partition. 
     7. If you wish to use Sieve, and you didn't configure deliver to look
        in home directories (see the imapd.conf man page), create the Sieve
        directory: 

           cd /usr
           mkdir sieve
           chown cyrus sieve
           chgrp mail sieve
           chmod 750 sieve

     8. Change to the Cyrus user and use the tool "tools/mkimap" to create
        the rest of the directories (subdirectories of the directories you
        just created). 

           su cyrus
           tools/mkimap
           exit


        If Perl is not available, it should be easy (but time consuming) to
        create these directories by hand. 

     9. LINUX SYSTEMS USING EXT2FS ONLY: Set the user, quota, and partition
        directories to update synchronously. Failure to do this may lead to
        data corruption and/or loss of mail after a system crash.
        Unfortunately, doing so may result in a serious performance hit. If
        you are using a newer filesystem than ext2fs on Linux, this step
        should not be necessary. (Running ext3 in any mode is safe.) 

           cd /var/imap
           chattr +S user quota user/* quota/*
           chattr +S /var/spool/imap /var/spool/imap/*

        Also set the queue directory of the mail daemon to update
        synchronously. The following example is for sendmail: 

           chattr +S /var/spool/mqueue

    10. To enable STARTTLS support, see how to configure OpenSSL below. 

    11. Add the following lines to the "/etc/services" file if they aren't
        already there. 

           pop3      110/tcp
           nntp      119/tcp
           imap      143/tcp
           imsp      406/tcp
           nntps     563/tcp
           acap      674/tcp
           imaps     993/tcp
           pop3s     995/tcp
           kpop      1109/tcp
           sieve     2000/tcp
           lmtp      2003/tcp
           fud       4201/udp

    12. Remove "/etc/[x]inetd.conf" entries. Any imap, imaps, pop3, pop3s,
        kpop, lmtp and sieve lines need to be removed from
        /etc/[x]inetd.conf and [x]inetd needs to be restarted. 

Configuring the Master Process

     1. Choose a configuration from the master/conf directory: 

        small.conf
                bare-bones server supporting IMAP and POP 
        normal.conf
                server supporting IMAP, POP, the SSL wrapped versions, and
                the Sieve script management protocol 
        prefork.conf
                The same configuration as above, but with some preforked
                processes for faster processing. 
        backend-cmu.conf
                Our configuration (for Murder Backend / typical IMAP
                servers) 
        frontend-cmu.conf
                Our configuration (for Murder Frontend servers) 

        To use normal.conf, do: 

           cp master/conf/normal.conf /etc/cyrus.conf

        Optionally, you can edit /etc/cyrus.conf to disable or enabling
        certain services, or to tune the number of preforked copies. Be
        sure not to remove the entries that are labeled required. 

     2. Arrange to start "/usr/cyrus/bin/master" as root when the system
        starts. It will bind some ports and then give up it's root
        privileges. Until your system reboots, you can start the master
        process by hand: 

           /usr/cyrus/bin/master &

     3. Monitor the progress of the master process by examining the
        imapd.log file. It should never exit by itself, but you can shut
        down the mail system by sending it a signal with kill. 

Configuring the Mail Transfer Agent

    In order to deliver mail to the Cyrus system, you'll have to configure
    your MTA (Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, etc) to use LMTP. 

Configuring Sendmail

    Generate a sendmail configuration file which delivers local mail to the
    IMAP server. See the file cf/README in the Sendmail distribution for
    information on how to create a complete configuration file. This file
    also lists variables that can be used to customize the mailer
    definitions mentioned below. 

    The following configurations assume that you are using the lmtpunix
    service from one of the sample cyrus.conf files discussed above. 

      * For Sendmail 8.12.4 and higher, use the cyrusv2 mailer definition
        in the Sendmail distribution: 

        define(`confLOCAL_MAILER', `cyrusv2')
        MAILER(`cyrusv2')

        If you wish to change the name of the UNIX socket or switch to TCP,
        define CYRUSV2_MAILER_ARGS appropriately as described in cf/README. 

      * For Sendmail 8.10 - 8.12.3, use the cyrusv2.mc file as a template
        to create a Sendmail configuration file. 

      * For Sendmail 8.9.x and earlier, use the cyrus mailer definition in
        the Sendmail distribution: 

        define(`confLOCAL_MAILER', `cyrus')
        MAILER(`cyrus')

        Edit /etc/group and add user "daemon" to the "mail" group. This
        will permit sendmail to run the "deliver" (LMTP client) program to
        deliver mail to the IMAP server. 

    Cyrus also includes a socket map daemon smmapd which can be used by
    Sendmail 8.13 and higher (a patch for 8.12 is available) to verify at
    RCPT TO time that a message can be delivered to the particular mailbox.
    To use this daemon, add smmapd as a service in cyrus.conf and configure
    Sendmail accordingly. 

Configuring Postfix

    The Postfix source distribution comes with the file
    "README_FILES/LMTP_README". Even if you are using a binary distribution
    of Postfix, it would be well worth your while to download the full
    Postfix source. Not only will you get the above file, but numerous
    other "readme" files and sample configuration files. 

    One thing you need to watch out for is the UID and GID of the Postfix
    software. As it states in the Postfix "INSTALL" document, you must
    create a new account that does not share its UID and GID with any other
    user account. This is for security reasons. If you installed Postfix
    with a GID of "mail", you will need to select a different GID for
    Cyrus. See the Cyrus configure options "--with-cyrus-user" and
    "--with-cyrus-group". (This was more crucial when the use of Cyrus'
    "deliver" was more prevalent, but it is still a good idea to follow
    this policy.) 

    Another thing to note is the location of your "sendmail" command. On
    some platforms this will be "/usr/sbin/sendmail", on others,
    "/usr/lib/sendmail". Cyrus will need to know where this command is. See
    Installing Sieve for more details. 

    Assuming that you are using the lmtpunix service from one of the sample
    cyrus.conf files discussed above, the Postfix configuration file
    "/etc/postfix/main.cf" should have the following line: 

      mailbox_transport = lmtp:unix:/var/imap/socket/lmtp

    Naturally, both the Postfix UID and the Cyrus UID need to be able to
    access the specified socket file. 

    Starting with Postfix snapshot-20010222, you can improve the efficiency
    of LMTP delivery via the "mailbox_transport" by putting the following
    entries in "/etc/postfix/main.cf": 

      local_destination_recipient_limit = 300
      local_destination_concurrency_limit = 5

    Of course you should adjust these settings as appropriate for the
    capacity of the hardware you are using. The recipient limit setting can
    be used to take advantage of the single instance message store
    capability of Cyrus. The concurrency limit can be used to control how
    many simultaneous LMTP sessions will be permitted to the Cyrus message
    store. 

    Additional examples are included in the Postfix file
    "README_FILES/LMTP_README". 

Configuring Exim 4

    Generate an Exim configuration file which delivers local mail to the
    IMAP server. See the Exim documentation for information on how to
    create a complete configuration file. 

    Cyrus is designed to be used as a black-box server -- there are usually
    no local user accounts. As a result, you must define the following
    "router": 

        localuser:
          driver = accept
          transport = local_delivery

    The following "transports" assume that you are using either the
    lmtpunix or lmtp service from one of the sample cyrus.conf files
    discussed above. 

      * Using lmtpunix (UNIX socket): 

        local_delivery:
          driver = lmtp
          command = "/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -l"
          batch_max = 20
          user = cyrus

      * Using lmtp (TCP socket -- Exim and Cyrus on same host): 

        local_delivery:
          driver = smtp
          protocol = lmtp
          hosts = localhost
          allow_localhost

    For more advanced configurations (such as address verification, etc),
    consult the Exim documentation and sample configurations. 

Exporting Netnews via IMAP

    If you wish to use export Netnews via IMAP, consult
    install-netnews.html. 

SSL, TLS, and OpenSSL

    Transport Layer Security (TLS), is a standardized version of the Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL v3) standard. IMAP can make use of two different
    versions of TLS/SSL: STARTTLS and an SSL wrapped session. 

    In STARTTLS, a client connects to the IMAP port as normal and then
    issues the STARTTLS command, which begins a TLS negotiation. This is
    currently supported by the Cyrus IMAP server when it is compiled with
    OpenSSL. 

    The alternative, a SSL wrapped connection, involves the client
    connected to a seperate port ("imaps") and negotiating a SSL session
    before starting the IMAP protocol. Again, this is supported natively by
    the Cyrus IMAP server when it is compiled with OpenSSL. 

    Both TLS and SSL require a server key and a certificate. Optionally, in
    addition to establishing a secure connection, TLS can authenticate the
    client. 

Configuring Cyrus with OpenSSL

     1. 
        OpenSSL requires the certificate and key in PEM format. You can
        create the server's private key and certificate yourself using
        OpenSSL. Here, we create a self-signed key for the machine "
        foobar.andrew.cmu.edu" and put both the certificate and key in the
        file "/var/imap/server.pem". 

        Please do not blindly enter in the information to OpenSSL below.
        Instead, enter the appropriate information for your organization
        (i.e. NOT Carnegie Mellon University for the Organization name,
        etc.). 

        openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out /var/imap/server.pem -keyout /var/imap/server.pem -days 365
        Using configuration from /usr/local/lib/openssl/openssl.cnf
        Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
        .............+++++
        ......................+++++
        writing new private key to '/var/imap/server.pem'
        -----
        You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
        into your certificate request.
        What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
        There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
        For some fields there will be a default value,
        If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
        -----
        Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
        State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Pennsylvania
        Locality Name (eg, city) []:Pittsburgh
        Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Carnegie Mellon University
        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Andrew Systems Group
        Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:foobar.andrew.cmu.edu
        Email Address []:

     2. Make sure to make key file(s) readable by the Cyrus user. For
        example: chown cyrus /var/imap/server.pem 
     3. Add the following to /etc/imapd.conf to tell the server where to
        find the certificate and key file (used for ALL services): 

        tls_cert_file: /var/imap/server.pem
        tls_key_file: /var/imap/server.pem

        Optionally, you can use separate certificates and key files for
        each service: 

        [servicename]_tls_cert_file: /var/imap/imap-server.pem
        [servicename]_tls_key_file: /var/imap/imap-server.pem

        "servicename" here refers to the name of the service as specified
        in cyrus.conf. It is not necessaraly the name of the binary. 

        This is useful if you want to use different hostnames for each
        service (e.g. via virtual host interfaces or DNS CNAMEs). In the
        absence of any of the service specific options, the value of the
        global option is used. A value of disabled for the certificate or
        key file for a particular service will disable SSL/TLS for that
        service. 

        If you have a Certificate Authority (CA), you may wish to generate
        a certificate request and send it to be signed by your CA. 

        By default, Cyrus will cache SSL/TLS sessions for reuse for up to
        24 hours. By adjusting the value of the tls_session_timeout option
        in imapd.conf, the session caching can be disabled (0) or the
        expiration period shortened. 

     4. You can test STARTTLS by using imtest: 

        imtest -t "" foobar.andrew.cmu.edu

Client-side certificates

    Client certificates are somewhat harder to configure than server
    certificates. You'll need a CA (certificate authority) and need to
    generate client certificates signed by that CA. STARTTLS in Sendmail
    and other MTAs have similiar problems, so Claus Assman's page is a good
    reference. 

    You can use the self-signed certificate generated above as a CA for
    client certificates. To do this, try the following: 

    TODO: write me! 

    Unfortunately, there's no standard on how to convert the client's
    authenticate DN (distinguished name) to a SASL authentication name. 

Alternate Namespace and UNIX Hierarchy Convention

    If you wish to use the alternate namespace and/or the UNIX hierarchy
    convention, consult altnamespace.html.
