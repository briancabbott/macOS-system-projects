SNMP Monitoring

    TODO:finish this section. The majority of this section will get moved
    to the external CySNIIP docs and this will be stuff specific to the
    imapd. 

    Cyrus uses an auxillary process called "tugowar", so named because
    there's a push-pull model. Various components of the Cyrus mail system
    push data to tugowar, and tugowar listens for SNMP queries (remote
    clients pull the data from tugowar).
