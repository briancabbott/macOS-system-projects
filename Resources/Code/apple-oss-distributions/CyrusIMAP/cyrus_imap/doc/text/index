Cyrus IMAP Server, version 2.3

    IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-track
    protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc). The Cyrus
    IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
    is generally intended to be run on sealed servers, where normal users
    are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of
    the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user
    access to messages is through the IMAP, POP3, KPOP or NNTP protocols. 

    The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages
    in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple concurrent
    read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
    supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on
    mailbox hierarchies. 

    The Cyrus project is the implementation of IMAP servers by the Carnegie
    Mellon University Computing Services Department. Over the next few
    months, we will be releasing components of this server, which will
    provide better mail security and easier mail administration.
