                Sieve: A mail filtering language

    Sieve is a Internet standards-track protocol for filtering messages on
    delivery. The Cyrus Sieve implementation supports filing messages into
    specific folders, forwarding messages, rejecting messages, and the
    standard vacation function. It can reply to messages based on headers
    or envelope information.
