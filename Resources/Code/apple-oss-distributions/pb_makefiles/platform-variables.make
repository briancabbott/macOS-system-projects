# Variable definitions that need to get included by platform.make at run-time
# during project builds.  Note that during the build of the pb_makefiles
# project itself, a new streamlined version of platform.make gets generated 
# under the control of the install-resources rule in Makefile.postamble.

#
# Paths to system directories for new directory layout.  These variables
# are defined here so that they can be used before common.make is included
# (e.g., when including $(LOCAL_MAKEFILEDIR)/<projecttype>.make.preamble.
