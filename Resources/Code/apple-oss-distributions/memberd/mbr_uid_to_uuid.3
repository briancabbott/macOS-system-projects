.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users and groups can be referred to in multiple ways.  In addition to the traditional uid and gid concepts, 
every user or group can be looked up by a 128 bit uuid.  In addition, if the user or group is hosted on a PDC
or Active Directory server, it will also have a 128 bit or larger sid.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_uid_to_uuid
will take a uid and look up the user the same way as getpwuid.  It will then return the uuid for that user.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_gid_to_uuid
does the same thing to get the uuid for a group.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id
takes a uuid that refers to a user or group and returns the uid or gid for the item.
.Fa id_type
will be filled in with either ID_TYPE_UID or ID_TYPE_GID to tell you which was found.  It is important to note that
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id
will always return an id even if the uuid is not found.  This returned id is not persistant, 
but can be used to map back to the uuid during runtime.  If you need to know if the uuid exists, 
you should call getgrgid on the returned id.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_sid_to_uuid
takes a sid and returns the associated uuid.  Like
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id
,
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_sid
will always return a uuid for the sid, even if the sid cannot be found.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_sid_to_uuid
will return a sid for the associate uuid if the item contains a sid.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
All function may return EIO if the memberd daemon is not reachable.  
They will also return ENOENT if the mapping could not be performed.
