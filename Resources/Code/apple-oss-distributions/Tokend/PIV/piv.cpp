	The call to SecKeychainSetServerMode is used to avoid recursion when
	doing keychain calls. The only place this is relevant is when we are
	setting the print name for the token using the common name from the
	certificate. Calling this will prevent any keychain-type calls from
	working but will still allow use of SecCertificate calls, etc.
	If the header is not available, you can safely undef _USECERTIFICATECOMMONNAME
