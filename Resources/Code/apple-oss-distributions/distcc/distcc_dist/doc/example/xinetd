# xinetd service description for distcc, contributed by akpm, updated
# by mbp.

# To use this, just check the parameters below and copy this file into
# /etc/xinet.d/distcc, or the appropriate location for your system,
# and then restart xinetd.  You should also create a 'distcc' user.

# ===> Note that running from inetd is generally NOT recommended for
# distcc. distccd should give better performance when it can run as a
# standalone daemon and regulate its own load.
