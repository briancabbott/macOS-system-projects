# This file contains a list of the compilers that distcc will allow to be remotely invoked.
# One compiler per line, newline separated, no whitespace allowed.

# Entries beginning with '/' are treated as the absolute path to a compiler.
# Other entires are relative. Normally, they will be relative to the parent directory of the tool (e.g. /usr/bin/distcc will map 'bin/cc' to /usr/bin/cc), unless the tool environment has USE_XCODE_SELECT_PATH=1, in which case they will be relative to the xcode-select(1) usr dir (e.g. 'bin/cc' becomes `xcode-select --print-path`/usr/bin/cc). USE_XCODE_SELECT_PATH is intended to allow distccd to use the developer toolchain out of the current developer directory.
