Title:	iODBC Driver Manager 

Version:	3.52.5

Description:	iODBC (independent Open Database Connectivity) 
		driver manager is compatible with ODBC 3.x specification
		and performs exactly same jobs of ODBC 3.x driver
		manager (i.e. driver loading, Parameters and function
		sequence checking, driver's function Invoking, etc.).

		Any ODBC driver that works with ODBC 3.0 driver manager
		will also work with iODBC driver manager and vice versa.
