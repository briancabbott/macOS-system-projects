libiodbc2 (3.51.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reverted the "-ld" patch from last upload. The problem that my iodbc
    libraries all had a TEXTREL symbol in them was simply caused do a "bug"
    in the libc6 package that made libdl.so a symlink pointing from 
    /usr/lib/ to ../../lib/ which does not work if /usr is on another 
    partition than /lib!
