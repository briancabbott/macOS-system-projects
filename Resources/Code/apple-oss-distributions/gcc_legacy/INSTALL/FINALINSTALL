                             Final install egcs
                                      
   Now that egcs has been built and tested, you can install it with `cd
   _objdir_; make install' for a native compiler or `cd _objdir_; make
   install LANGUAGES="c c++"' for a cross compiler (note installing cross
   compilers will be easier in the next release!).
   
   That step completes the installation of egcs; user level binaries can
   be found in _prefix_/bin where _prefix_ is the value you specified
   with the --prefix to configure (or /usr/local by default).
   
   If you don't mind, please quickly review the [1]build status page. If
   your system is not listed, send a note to [2]egcs@egcs.cygnus.com
   indicating that you successfully built and installed egcs. Include the
   output from running _srcdir_/config.guess. (Do not send us the
   config.guess file itself, just the output from running it!)
   
   If you find a bug in egcs, please report it to
   [3]egcs-bugs@egcs.cygnus.com.
