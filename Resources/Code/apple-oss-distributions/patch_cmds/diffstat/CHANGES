2007/09/04 (diffstat 1.45)

	+ add "-b" option (Debian #379380, patch by Greg Norris).

2007/08/26 (diffstat 1.44)

	+ add a check for default-diff output, e.g., "diff foo bar|diffstat",
	  which has no "diff" command in the output for diffstat to guess that
	  a diff is beginning.

	+ add a check after completing a chunk for unified diff to ensure that
	  the next line either begins another chunk for the diff, or starts
	  another diff, e.g., a context diff (report by Adrian Bunk).

	+ use install-sh rather than install.sh

	  ordering the binary tree (report by Adrian Bunk).

2006/07/02 (diffstat 1.42)

	+ do not ignore pathnames in /tmp/, since some tools create usable
	  for both old/new files there (Debian #376086).

	+ correct ifdef for fgetc_unlocked().

	+ updated configure macros CF_GCC_VERSION, CF_PATH_SYNTAX and
	  CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

	+ add configure check for compress, gzip and bzip2 programs that may be
	  used to decompress files.

	+ update usage message for options added in 1.40 (report by Eric Blake).

2005-08-15 (diffstat 1.40)

	+ add options -l, -r and -t.  add to -f option (patch, comments by
	  Jean Delvare, Michael Burian).

	+ improve I/O on Linux using fgetc_locked().

	+ improve searching of long sorted lists using tsearch()

	+ improve configure-script checks for Intel compiler warnings.

2005-04-10 (diffstat 1.39)

	+ change order of merging and prefix-stripping so stripping all prefixes,
	  e.g., with -p9, will be sorted as expected (patch by Jean Delvare).

	+ correct a reference to freed memory after merging found with valgrind.

2005-01-16 (diffstat 1.38)

	+ add makefile.wnt, etc., for win32 port.

	+ fix "make check" to work even when PATH or the build directory has
	  spaces in it (patch by Eric Blake).

	+ add support for '--help' and '--version' command line arguments, for a
	  consistent interface with GNU tools, and still compatible to POSIX
	  requirements on utility options (patch by Eric Blake).

2004-12-18

	+ modify makefile.in and run_test.sh to allow "make check" to be run
	  from a build directory which is not the same as the source directory,
	  i.e., when the configure --srcdir option is used (request by Eric
	  Blake).

	+ modify distribution to include sample of regression tests, so a
	  "make check" will work (request by Eric Blake).

2004-12-16 (diffstat 1.37)

	+ fix a different case for data beginning with "--" which was treated
	  as a header line.

2004-12-14 (diffstat 1.36)

	+ Fix allocation problems.  Open files in binary mode for reading.
	  Getopt returns -1, not necessarily EOF.  Add const where useful.  Use
	  NO_IDENT where necessary.  malloc() comes from <stdlib.h> in standard
	  systems (Patch by Eric Blake <ebb9@byu.net>.)

2004-11-08 (diffstat 1.35)

	+ modify makefile.in to work with configure --srcdir option (report by
	  Eric Blake).

	+ minor fix for resync of unified diffs checks for range (line beginning
	  with '@' without header lines (successive lines beginning with "---"
	  and "+++") (Debian #264098).

	+ miscellaneous updates for configure script

2003-11-09 (diffstat 1.34)

	+ improve check for certain lines (not those that begin a chunk) that
	  begin with '-', treating all except "---" as a delete (report by
	  James Rowe <Jay@jnrowe.uklinux.net>).

	+ minor updates to configure script.

2003-02-14 (diffstat 1.33)

	+ modified to work around a case where the filename+date was incomplete,
	  i.e., missing one of the components such as the day of the month.
	  While diffstat does not use the date directly, it helps distinguish
	  some lines from non-patches (report by Moritz Barsnick
	  <moritz@barsnick.net>).

	+ add "-h" option (request by Moritz Barsnick).

	+ fix a typo in usage message (report by Moritz Barsnick).

	+ add "-e" and "-o" options to simplify testing on OS/2 EMX.

2003-01-04 (diffstat 1.32)

	+ modified to handle patches generated by makepatch-2.00_09, which uses
	  both "Index" and "diff" lines (report by D Roland Walker).  As a side
	  effect, the additional merging eliminates occasional reports with
	  zero differences.

	+ modified to avoid buffer overflows.

	+ fixes for Debian #155000 (did not handle a '-' in first
	  content-column of a unified diff) and Debian #170947 (option to turn
	  the progress messages off).

	+ updated configure script using aclocal.m4 macros

	+ update makefile.in to improve use of autoconf (report/patch by Nix
	  <nix@esperi.demon.co.uk>).

2002-08-20 (diffstat 1.31)

	+ add -u, -k options to override diffstat's normal sorting (-u) and
	  merging (-k) of identical filenames.  (-u requested by H Peter Anvin
	  <hpa@zytor.com>).

2002-08-09 (diffstat 1.30)

	+ allow either '/' or '-' as delimiters in dates, to accommodate
	  gendiff (report by Rik van Riel <riel@conectiva.com.br>).  This
	  corresponds to the time format used in diffutils 2.8 whose changelog
	  states that this is ISO 8601 (though online references differ).

2001-10-10 (diffstat 1.29)

	+ add bzip2 (.bz2) suffix (suggested by Gregory T Norris
	  <haphazard@socket.net>, Debian #82969).

	+ add check for diff from RCS archive where the "diff" lines do not
	  reference a filename.

2000-03-29 (diffstat 1.28)

	+ Add -c option (to prefix output with '#' comment), eliminating a step
	  in my script that combines diffstat output with a patch.  This is a
	  workaround for OSF1's broken sed utility.

	+ Check for compressed file suffixes .Z and .gz, read uncompressed data
	  via pipe (Debian #53975 by ch@lathspell.westend.com).

	+ Simplified makefile based on comments by M Sweger
	  <mikesw@whiterose.net>

	+ Adapted changes from Troy Engel <tengel@sonic.net> as "-f" option.

1998-05-27 (diffstat 1.27)

	+ Debian diff's don't show dates on the lines where we expect to see
	  filenames.

1998-01-16 (diffstat 1.26, Patch 5)

	+ Change copyright terms.

 	+ Accommodate patches w/o tabs in header lines (e.g., from cut/paste).
	  Still prefer the tabs because otherwise we cannot have spaces in
	  filenames.

 	+ Strip suffixes such as ".orig", to avoid confusing output.

1996-03-16 (diffstat 1.24, Patch 4)

	+ Corrected state-transition after "Binary".

	+ Added testing subdirectory

	+ Added -p option.

	+ Handle differences from /tmp (e.g., for X11R5 patches).

1995-05-06 (diffstat 1.17, Patch 3)

	+ Repost whole program to comp.sources.misc (1.17)

	+ Mods to scaling: limit to 1:1 if only a few changes were made; added
	  logic to accumulate error across +/-/!  calls.

	+ added logic to recognize 'rcsdiff -u' output.

1994-12-26 (diffstat 1.15, Patch 2)

	+ Strip common pathname prefix (1.15)

1994-11-13 (diffstat 1.14, Patch 1)

	+ Test for <string.h> vs <strings.h>

	+ Corrected error in 'match()' that didn't handle properly the case
	  when an argument was a null string (i.e., blank lines in a unified
	  diff).

	+ Added options '-n' and '-V'

	+ Added patchlev.h, CHANGES files.

	+ Added install.sh, for autoconf 2.1

1994-06-13 (diffstat 1.12, Patch 0)

	+ Initial release of 'diffstat' (1.12).
