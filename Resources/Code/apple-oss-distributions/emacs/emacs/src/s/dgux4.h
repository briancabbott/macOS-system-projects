/* This file was written by Roderick Schertler <roderick@ibcinc.com>,
   contact me if you have problems with or comments about running Emacs
   on dgux.

   A number of things in the older dgux*.h files don't make sense to me,
   but since I'm relying on memory and I don't have any older dgux
   systems installed on which to test changes I'm undoing or fixing them
   here rather than fixing them at the source. */

/* In dgux.h it says "Can't use sys_signal because then etc/server.c
   would need sysdep.o." and then it #defines signal() to be
   berk_signal(), but emacsserver.c does `#undef signal' anyway, so that
   doesn't make sense.

   Further, sys_signal() in sysdep.c already had a special case for
   #ifdef DGUX, it called berk_signal() explicitly.  I've removed that
   special case because it also didn't make sense:  All versions of dgux
   which the dgux*.h headers take into account have POSIX signals
   (POSIX_SIGNALS is #defined in dgux.h).  The comments in sys_signal()
   even acknowledged this (saying that the special berk_signal() case
   wasn't really necessary), they said that sys_signal() was using
   berk_signal() instead of sigaction() for efficiency.  Since both give
   reliable signals neither has to be invoked within the handler.  If
   the efficiency that the comments were talking about is the overhead
   of setting up the sigaction struct rather than just passing the
   function pointer in (which is the only efficiency I can think of)
   then that's a needless optimization, the Emacs sources do better
   without the special case.

   The following definition will prevent dgux.h from re-defining
   signal().  I can't just say `#undef signal' after including dgux.h
   because signal() is already a macro, defined in <sys/signal.h>, and
   the original definition would be lost. */

   jmp_buf, so sigsetjmp() is being called with a jmp_buf rather than a
   sigjmp_buf, and the buffer is then passed to vanilla longjmp().  This
   provides a more complete emulation of the Berkeley semantics. */

/* The BAUD_CONVERT definition in dgux.h is wrong with this version
   of dgux, but I'm not sure when it changed.

   With the current system Emacs' standard handling of ospeed and
   baud_rate don't work.  The baud values (B9600 and so on) returned by
   cfgetospeed() aren't compatible with those used by ospeed.  speed_t,
   the type returned by cfgetospeed(), is unsigned long and speed_t
   values are large.  Further, it isn't possible to get at both the
   SysV3 (ospeed) and POSIX (cfgetospeed()) values through symbolic
   constants simultaneously because they both use the same names
   (B9600).  To get both baud_rate and ospeed right at the same time
   it's necessary to hardcode the values for one set of values, here I'm
   hardcoding ospeed. */
