/* Emacs can read input using SIGIO and buffering characters itself,
   or using CBREAK mode and making C-g cause SIGINT.
   The choice is controlled by the variable interrupt_input.

   Define INTERRUPT_INPUT to make interrupt_input = 1 the default (use SIGIO)

   Emacs uses the presence or absence of the SIGIO macro to indicate
   whether or not signal-driven I/O is possible.  It uses
   INTERRUPT_INPUT to decide whether to use it by default.

   SIGIO can be used only on systems that implement it (4.2 and 4.3).
   CBREAK mode has two disadvantages
     1) At least in 4.2, it is impossible to handle the Meta key properly.
        I hear that in system V this problem does not exist.
     2) Control-G causes output to be discarded.
        I do not know whether this can be fixed in system V.

   Another method of doing input is planned but not implemented.
   It would have Emacs fork off a separate process
   to read the input and send it to the true Emacs process
   through a pipe. */
