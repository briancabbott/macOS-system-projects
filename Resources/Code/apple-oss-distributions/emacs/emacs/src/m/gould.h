/* machine description file for Gould PowerNodes with UTX/32 2.0 and 2.1.
   (See MACHINES for older versions.)

* NOTE: If you are running a pre-release of UTX/32 2.1 you should #define
* RELEASE2_1 in config.h. This may also be necessary with un-updated
* official releases of 2.1

/* The following line tells the configuration script what sort of
   operating system this machine is likely to run.
   USUAL-OPSYS="note"

NOTE-START
Gould Power Node (-machine=gould -opsystem=bsd4-2 or bsd4-3)
(gould.h; s-bsd4-2.h or s-bsd4-3.h)

  18.36 worked on versions 1.2 and 2.0 of the operating system.

  On UTX/32 2.0, use -opsystem=bsd4-3

  On UTX/32 1.2 and UTX/32S 1.0, use -opsystem=bsd4-2 and note that compiling
  lib-src/sorted-doc tickles a compiler bug:  remove the -g flag to cc in the
  makefile.

  UTX/32 1.3 has a bug in the bcopy library routine.  Fix it by
  #undef BSTRING in gould.h.

  Version 19 incorporates support for releases 2.1 and later of UTX/32.
  A site running a pre-release of 2.1 should #define RELEASE2_1 in config.h.
