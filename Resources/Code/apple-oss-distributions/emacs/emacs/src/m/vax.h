/* The following line tells the configuration script what sort of
   operating system this machine is likely to run.
   USUAL-OPSYS="note"

NOTE-START
The vax (-machine=vax) runs zillions of different operating systems.

Vax running Berkeley Unix (-opsystem=bsd4-1, -opsystem=bsd4-2 or
			   -opsystem=bsd4-3)

  Works.

Vax running Ultrix (-opsystem=bsd4-2)

  Works.  See under Ultrix in share-lib/MACHINES for problems using X
  windows on Ultrix.

Vax running System V rel 2 (-opsystem=usg5-2)

  18.27 Works.

Vax running System V rel 0 (-opsystem=usg5-0)

  Works as of 18.36.

Vax running VMS (-opsystem=vms)

  18.36 believed to work.  Addition of features is necessary to make
  this Emacs version more usable.
