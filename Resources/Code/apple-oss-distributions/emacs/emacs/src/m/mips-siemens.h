   This file contains some changes for our SVR4 based SINIX-Mips 5.4.
   I hope this is helpful to port the emacs to our RM?00 series and
   maybe to the DC/OSx (Mips-based) machines of Pyramid Inc.

   USUAL-OPSYS="note"

NOTE-START
Use m-mips4.h for RISCOS version 4; use s-bsd4-3.h with the BSD world.
Note that the proper m- file for the Decstation is m-pmax.h.
This is the m- file for SNI RM*00 machines. Use s- sinix5-4.h file!
With this the file mips-siemens.h is obsolete.
