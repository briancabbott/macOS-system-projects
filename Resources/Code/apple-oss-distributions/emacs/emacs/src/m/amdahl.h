This file for amdahl_uts created by modifying the template.h
by Jishnu Mukerji 3/1/87

The following line tells the configuration script what sort of
operating system this machine is likely to run.
USUAL-OPSYS="usg5-2-2"

This file works with the Amdahl uts native C compiler. The 5.2u370
compiler is so brain damaged that it is not even worth trying to use it.
