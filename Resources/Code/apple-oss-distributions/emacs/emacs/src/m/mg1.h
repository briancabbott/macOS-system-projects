NOTE-START
We are in the dark about what operating system runs on the Whitechapel
systems.  Consult share-lib/MACHINES for information on which
operating systems Emacs has already been ported to; one of them might
work.  If you find an existing system name that works or write your
own configuration files, please let the Free Software Foundation in on
your work; we'd like to distribute this information.
