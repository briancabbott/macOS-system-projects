/* The following line tells the configuration script what sort of
   operating system this machine is likely to run.
   USUAL-OPSYS="note"

NOTE-START
Intel 386 (-machine=intel386 or -machine=is386.h)

  The possibilities for -opsystem are: bsd4-2, usg5-2-2, usg5-3,
  isc2-2, 386-ix, esix, linux, sco3.2v4, and xenix.

  18.58 should support a wide variety of operating systems.
  Use isc2-2 for Interactive 386/ix version 2.2.
  Use 386ix for prior versions.
  Use esix for Esix.
  Use linux for Linux.
  It isn't clear what to do on an SCO system.

  -machine=is386 is used for an Integrated Solutions 386 machine.
  It may also be correct for Microport systems.

Cubix QBx/386 (-machine=intel386 -opsystem=usg5-3)

  Changes merged in 19.1.  Systems before 2/A/0 may fail to compile etags.c
  due to a compiler bug.

Prime EXL (-machine=intel386 -opsystem=usg5-3)

  Minor changes merged in 19.1.
