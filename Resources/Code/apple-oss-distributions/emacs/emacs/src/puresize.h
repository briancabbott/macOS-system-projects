/* Define PURESIZE, the number of bytes of pure Lisp code to leave space for.

   At one point, this was defined in config.h, meaning that changing
   PURESIZE would make Make recompile all of Emacs.  But only a few
   files actually use PURESIZE, so we split it out to its own .h file.

   Make sure to include this file after config.h, since that tells us
   whether we are running X windows, which tells us how much pure
   storage to allocate.  */
