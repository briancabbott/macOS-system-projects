/* Length of echobuf field in each KBOARD.  */

/* Each KBOARD represents one logical input stream from which Emacs gets input.
   If we are using an ordinary terminal, it has one KBOARD object.
   Usually each X display screen has its own KBOARD,
   but when two of them are on the same X server,
   we assume they share a keyboard and give them one KBOARD in common.

   Some Lisp variables are per-kboard; they are stored in the KBOARD structure
   and accessed indirectly via a Lisp_Misc_Kboard_Objfwd object.

   So that definition of keyboard macros, and reading of prefix arguments,
   can happen in parallel on various KBOARDs at once,
   the state information for those activities is stored in the KBOARD.

   Emacs has two states for reading input:

   ** Any kboard.  Emacs can accept input from any KBOARD,
   and as soon as any of them provides a complete command, Emacs can run it.

   ** Single kboard.  Then Emacs is running a command for one KBOARD
   and can only read input from that KBOARD.

   All input, from all KBOARDs, goes together in a single event queue
   at interrupt level.  read_char sees the events sequentially,
   but deals with them in accord with the current input state.

   In the any-kboard state, read_key_sequence processes input from any KBOARD
   immediately.  When a new event comes in from a particular KBOARD,
   read_key_sequence switches to that KBOARD.  As a result,
   as soon as a complete key arrives from some KBOARD or other,
   Emacs starts executing that key's binding.  It switches to the
   single-kboard state for the execution of that command,
   so that that command can get input only from its own KBOARD.

   While in the single-kboard state, read_char can consider input only
   from the current KBOARD.  If events come from other KBOARDs, they
   are put aside for later in the KBOARDs' kbd_queue lists.
   The flag kbd_queue_has_data in a KBOARD is 1 if this has happened.
   When Emacs goes back to the any-kboard state, it looks at all the KBOARDs
   to find those; and it tries processing their input right away.  */

       avoid blocking out the other KBOARDs.  See universal-argument in
