/* Jim Blandy <jimb@occs.cs.oberlin.edu> - September 1992

   When using GCC 2 as the linker in the build process, options
   intended for the linker need to be prefixed with the "-Xlinker"
   option.  If an option takes an argument, we need to use -Xlinker
   twice - once for the option and once for its argument.  For
   example, to run the linker with the options "-Bstatic" "-e"
   "_start", you'd need to pass the following options to GCC:

   -Xlinker -Bstatic -Xlinker -e -Xlinker _start.

   The Emacs makefile used to use a Bourne Shell `for' loop to prefix
   each linker option with "-Xlinker", but 1) the for loop was hairier
   than one might hope because it had to work when there were no
   arguments to pass to the linker - the shell barfs on a loop like
   this:

       for arg in ; do echo -Xlinker "$arg"; done

   and 2) the whole compilation command containing this loop seems to
   exit with a non-zero status and halt the build under Ultrix.

   If I can't write a completely portable program to do this in C,
   I'm quitting and taking up gardening.  */
