/* Scan the current buffer forward from offset FROM, pretending that
   this is at line FROMVPOS, column FROMHPOS, until reaching buffer
   offset TO or line TOVPOS, column TOHPOS (whichever comes first),
   and return the ending buffer position and screen location.  If we
   can't hit the requested column exactly (because of a tab or other
   multi-column character), overshoot.

   DID_MOTION is 1 if FROMHPOS has already accounted for overlay strings
   at FROM.  This is the case if FROMVPOS and FROMVPOS came from an
   earlier call to compute_motion.  The other common case is that FROMHPOS
   is zero and FROM is a position that "belongs" at column zero, but might
   be shifted by overlay strings; in this case DID_MOTION should be 0.

   WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text;
   compute_motion uses this to handle continuation lines and such.
   If WIDTH is -1, use width of window's text area adjusted for
   continuation glyph when needed.

   HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left
   margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.
   TAB_OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't
   being displayed, perhaps because of a continuation line or
   something.

   compute_motion returns a pointer to a struct position.  The bufpos
   member gives the buffer position at the end of the scan, and hpos
   and vpos give its cartesian location.  prevhpos is the column at
   which the character before bufpos started, and contin is non-zero
   if we reached the current line by continuing the previous.

   Note that FROMHPOS and TOHPOS should be expressed in real screen
   columns, taking HSCROLL and the truncation glyph at the left margin
   into account.  That is, beginning-of-line moves you to the hpos
   -HSCROLL + (HSCROLL > 0).

   For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE
   of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as FROM
   and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMVPOS and FROMHPOS.
   Pass the buffer's ZV as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the
   visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOVPOS and
   TOHPOS.

   When displaying in window w, a typical formula for WIDTH is:

	window_width - 1
	 - (has_vertical_scroll_bars
	    ? WINDOW_CONFIG_SCROLL_BAR_COLS (window)
	    : (window_width + window_left != frame_cols))

	where
	  window_width is XFASTINT (w->total_cols),
	  window_left is XFASTINT (w->left_col),
	  has_vertical_scroll_bars is
	    WINDOW_HAS_VERTICAL_SCROLL_BAR (window)
	  and frame_cols = FRAME_COLS (XFRAME (window->frame))

   Or you can let window_box_text_cols do this all for you, and write:
	window_box_text_cols (w) - 1

   The `-1' accounts for the continuation-line backslashes; the rest
   accounts for window borders if the window is split horizontally, and
   the scroll bars if they are turned on.  */

Scan the current buffer forward from offset FROM,
assuming it is at position FROMPOS--a cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--
to position TO or position TOPOS--another cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--
and return the ending buffer position and screen location.

If TOPOS is nil, the actual width and height of the window's
text area are used.

There are three additional arguments:

WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text;
this affects handling of continuation lines.  A value of nil
corresponds to the actual number of available text columns.

OFFSETS is either nil or a cons cell (HSCROLL . TAB-OFFSET).
HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left
margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.
TAB-OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't
being displayed, perhaps because the line was continued within it.
If OFFSETS is nil, HSCROLL and TAB-OFFSET are assumed to be zero.

WINDOW is the window to operate on.  It is used to choose the display table;
if it is showing the current buffer, it is used also for
deciding which overlay properties apply.
Note that `compute-motion' always operates on the current buffer.

The value is a list of five elements:
  (POS HPOS VPOS PREVHPOS CONTIN)
POS is the buffer position where the scan stopped.
VPOS is the vertical position where the scan stopped.
HPOS is the horizontal position where the scan stopped.

PREVHPOS is the horizontal position one character back from POS.
CONTIN is t if a line was continued after (or within) the previous character.

For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE
of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as FROM
and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMPOS.
Pass the buffer's (point-max) as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the
visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOPOS.  */)

       doc: /* Move point to start of the screen line LINES lines down.
If LINES is negative, this means moving up.

This function is an ordinary cursor motion function
which calculates the new position based on how text would be displayed.
The new position may be the start of a line,
or just the start of a continuation line.
The function returns number of screen lines moved over;
that usually equals LINES, but may be closer to zero
if beginning or end of buffer was reached.

The optional second argument WINDOW specifies the window to use for
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.

`vertical-motion' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.
This is consistent with other cursor motion functions
and makes it possible to use `vertical-motion' in any buffer,
whether or not it is currently displayed in some window.  */)
