2007-03-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	unfinished chapters.
	(Sample Configuration): Write.

	release.

	tips and tricks in the sample configuration, commented out.

	* erc-bbdb.el (erc-bbdb-search-name-and-create): Make prompt more
	informative about how to skip merging.
	(erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry-1): Move contents of

	(erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry): Run
	erc-bbdb-insinuate-and-show-entry-1 "outside" of the calling
	function, so that we can avoid triggering a process-filter error
	if the user hits C-g.

2007-03-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* FOR-RELEASE: Solve C-c C-SPC keybinding dilemma.

	* erc-autoaway.el (erc-autoaway-idle-method): Use `if' rather than
	`cond' and `set' rather than `set-default'.

	* erc-log.el: Avoid compiler warning by requiring erc-network
	during compilation.
	(erc-generate-log-file-name-function): Add tag to each option.
	Add erc-generate-log-file-name-network.

	a log file name that uses network name rather than server name,
	when possible.

	* erc-track.el (track): Assimilate track-when-inactive module,

	erc-track-minor-mode-maybe, and tear down the minor mode when
	disabling.
	(erc-track-when-inactive): New option which determines whether to
	track visible buffers when inactive.  The default is not to do so.

	(erc-buffer-visible): Use erc-track-when-inactive.
	(erc-track-enable-keybindings): New option which determines

	default is to do so, unless they would override another binding,
	in which case we prompt the user about it.
	(erc-track-minor-mode-map): Move global keybindings here.
	(erc-track-minor-mode): New minor mode which only enables the
	keybindings and does nothing else.
	(erc-track-minor-mode-maybe): New function which starts
	erc-track-minor-mode, but only if it hasn't already been started,
	an ERC buffer exists, and the user OK's it, depending on the value
	of `erc-track-enable-keybindings'.
	(erc-track-switch-buffer): Display a message if someone calls this
	without first enabling erc-track-mode.

	* erc-autoaway.el (erc-autoaway-idle-method): When setting the new
	value, disable and re-enable `erc-autoaway-mode' only if it was
	already enabled.  This fixes a bug where autoaway was enabled just

2007-03-10  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-capab.el: Added more information to the Usage section.

	(erc-capab-identify-get-unidentified-nickname): Renamed from
	`erc-capab-get-unidentified-nickname'.

	`erc-capab-identify-unidentified' as the face.

	* erc-backend.el (290): Moved here from erc-capab.el.

	* erc.el (erc-select): Added an autoload cookie.
	(erc-message-type-member, erc-restore-text-properties): Use
	`erc-get-parsed-vector'.
	(erc-auto-query): Set the default to 'bury since many new users
	expect private messages from others to be in dedicated query
	buffers, not the server buffer.
	(erc-common-server-suffixes): Use "freenode" for freenode.net, not
	"OPN".  Added oftc.net.

	* erc.el (erc-open, erc): Docfixes.

2007-03-02  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* FOR-RELEASE: Make section for 5.3 release and move erc-backend
	cleanup there.  Awaiting discussion before doing other things.
	Add tasks for merging filename changes from the 5.2 release
	branch, and for making a tarball of modules not in Emacs 22.  Add
	item to remind me to update NEWS.  Mark backtab entry as done.

	default of 30 seconds.  Improve customize interface.
	(erc-server-send-ping-timeout): New option that determines when to
	consider a connection stalled and restart it.  The default is
	after 120 seconds.
	(erc-server-send-ping): Use erc-server-send-ping-timeout instead
	of erc-server-send-ping-interval.  If
	erc-server-send-ping-timeout is nil, do not ever kill and restart
	a hung IRC process.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Include the name of the module in its
	description.  This should make it easier for people to find and
	enable a particular module.

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-RECONNECT): Kill old process if it is still

	reason.

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-reconnecting): New variable that is
	set when the user requests a reconnect, but the old process is
	still alive.  This forces the reconnect to work even though the
	process is killed manually during reconnect.
	(erc-server-connect): Initialize it.
	(erc-server-reconnect-p): Use it.
	(erc-process-sentinel-1): Set it to nil after the first reconnect
	attempt.

2007-02-07  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-menu.el (erc-menu-definition): Fixed so that the separator
	is between "Current channel" and "Pals, fools and other keywords",
	not at the bottom of the "Current channel" submenu.

2007-01-25  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-networks.el (erc-server-alist): Removed SSL server for now
	since `erc-server-select' doesn't know to use `erc-ssl'.

	definitions for oftc.net.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-alist): Fixed OFTC message regexp.

2007-01-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-error-occurred): New variable that
	indicates when an error has been signaled by the server.  This
	should fix an infinite reconnect bug when giving some servers a
	bogus :full-name.  Thanks to Angelina Carlton for the report.
	(erc-server-connect): Initialize erc-server-error-occurred.
	(erc-server-reconnect-p): Use it.
	(ERROR): Set it.

	erc-nickserv-alist.

2007-01-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-header-line-format): Document how to disable the

	changes take effect immediately.

2007-01-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.texi (Modules): Document new menu module.  Thanks to Leo
	for noticing.

2007-01-16  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-timestamp-left): Fixed so that the
	whitespace string filler is hidden correctly when timestamps are
	hidden.
	(erc-toggle-timestamps): New function to use instead of
	`erc-show-timestamps' and `erc-hide-timestamps'.

	* erc.el (erc-restore-text-properties): Moved here from
	erc-fill.el since it could be useful in general.

	* erc-fill.el (erc-restore-text-properties): Removed.

2007-01-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-command-regexp): New variable that is used to match
	a command.
	(erc-send-input): Use it.  This fixes a bug where paths --
	"/usr/bin/foo", for example -- were being displayed as commands,
	but still sent correctly.
	(erc-extract-command-from-line): Use it.

	* erc.texi (Modules): Document erc-capab-identify.

2007-01-11  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	since it can be useful in general.

	* erc-track.el (erc-find-parsed-property): Removed.

	* erc-capab.el (erc-capab-find-parsed): Removed.
	(erc-capab-identify-add-prefix): Use `erc-find-parsed-property'.

	* erc.el (erc-open): Run `erc-before-connect' hook here.  This
	makes sure the hook always gets called before a connection is
	made, as some functions, like `erc-handle-irc-url', use `erc-open'
	instead of `erc'.
	(erc): Removed `erc-before-connect' hook.

	* erc-menu.el (erc-menu-definition): Put items specific to
	channels in a "Current channel" submenu.

	* erc-backend.el (321, 323): Display channel list in server buffer
	when not using the channel list module.

	* erc.el: Updated copyright years.

	documentation.

	* erc-services.el (erc-nickserv-identify-mode): Improve
	documentation for nick-change option and move higher to fix
	compiler warning.  Avoid a recursive load error.
	(erc-nickserv-alist): Add simple entry for BitlBee, to avoid
	"NickServ is AWAY: User is offline" error.  Oddly enough, bitlbee
	was smart enough to recognize that as an authentication request
	and log in regardless, which is why I didn't notice this earlier.
	(erc-nickserv-alist-sender, erc-nickserv-alist-regexp)
	(erc-nickserv-alist-nickserv, erc-nickserv-alist-ident-keyword)
	(erc-nickserv-alist-use-nick-p)
	(erc-nickserv-alist-ident-command): New accessors for
	erc-nickserv-alist.  Using nth is unwieldy.
	(erc-nickserv-identify-autodetect)
	(erc-nickserv-identify-on-connect)
	(erc-nickserv-identify-on-nick-change, erc-nickserv-identify): Use
	the new accessors.

2007-01-11  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* NEWS: Added note for `erc-my-nick-face'.  Fixed capab-identify
	wording.

2007-01-10  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc.el (erc-mode-line-format): Added %l to documentation.

	from mode string.

	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Use it.

2007-01-09  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-system-name): New option that determines the system
	name to use when logging in.  The default is to figure this out by
	calling `system-name'.
	(erc-login): Use it.

2007-01-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Add the menu module.  This should fix a
	bug with incorrect ERC submenus being displayed.

	* erc-menu.el: Turn this into a module.
	(erc-menu-add, erc-menu-remove): New functions that add and remove
	the ERC menu.
