FONT-INFO is a list of the following format:

BDFFILE is a name of a font file (excluding directory part).

ABSOLUTE-PATH is an absolute path of the font file.

MOD-TIME is last modification time as a list of two integers, the
first integer has high-order 16 bits, the second has low 16 bits.

SIZE is a size of the font.  This value is got from SIZE record of the
font.

FONT-BOUNDING-BOX is the font bounding box as a list of four integers,
BBX-WIDTH, BBX-HEIGHT, BBX-XOFF, and BBX-YOFF.

RELATIVE-COMPOSE is an integer value of the font's property
`_MULE_RELATIVE_COMPOSE'.  If the font doesn't have this property, the
value is 0.

BASELINE-OFFSET is an integer value of the font's property
`_MULE_BASELINE_OFFSET'.  If the font doesn't have this property, the
value is 0.

CODE-RANGE is a vector of minimum 1st byte, maximum 1st byte, minimum
2nd byte, maximum 2nd byte, minimum code, maximum code, and default
code.  For 1-byte fonts, the first two elements are 0.

MAXLEN is a maximum bytes of one glyph information in the font file.

OFFSET-VECTOR is a vector of a file position which starts bitmap data
of the glyph in the font file.

Nth element of OFFSET-VECTOR is a file position for the glyph of code
