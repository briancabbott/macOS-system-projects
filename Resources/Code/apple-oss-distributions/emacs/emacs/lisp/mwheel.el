;;; Commentary:

;; This code will enable the use of the infamous 'wheel' on the new
;; crop of mice.  Under XFree86 and the XSuSE X Servers, the wheel
;; events are sent as button4/button5 events.

;; I for one would prefer some way of converting the button4/button5
;; events into different event types, like 'mwheel-up' or
;; 'mwheel-down', but I cannot find a way to do this very easily (or
;; portably), so for now I just live with it.

;; To enable this code, simply put this at the top of your .emacs
;; file:
;;
;; (mouse-wheel-mode 1)

;;; Code:

(require 'custom)
(require 'timer)

;; Setter function for mouse-button user-options.  Switch Mouse Wheel
;; mode off and on again so that the old button is unbound and
;; new button is bound to mwheel-scroll.
