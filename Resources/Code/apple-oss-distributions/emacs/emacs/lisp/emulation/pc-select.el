;;; Commentary:

;; This package emulates the mark, copy, cut and paste look-and-feel of motif
;; programs (which is the same as the MAC gui and (sorry for that) MS-Windows).
;; It modifies the keybindings of the cursor keys and the next, prior,
;; home and end keys. They will modify mark-active.
;; You can still get the old behaviour of cursor moving with the
;; control sequences C-f, C-b, etc.
;; This package uses transient-mark-mode and
;; delete-selection-mode.
;;
;; In addition to that all key-bindings from the pc-mode are
;; done here too (as suggested by RMS).
;;
;; As I found out after I finished the first version, s-region.el tries
;; to do the same.... But my code is a little more complete and using
;; delete-selection-mode is very important for the look-and-feel.
;; Pete Forman <pete.forman@airgun.wg.waii.com> provided some motif
;; compliant keybindings which I added. I had to modify them a little
;; to add the -mark and -nomark functionality of cursor moving.
;;
;; Credits:
;; Many thanks to all who made comments.
;; Thanks to RMS and Ralf Muschall <prm@rz.uni-jena.de> for criticism.
;; Kevin Cutts <cutts@ukraine.corp.mot.com> added the beginning-of-buffer
;; and end-of-buffer functions which I modified a little.
;; David Biesack <sasdjb@unx.sas.com> suggested some more cleanup.
;; Thanks to Pete Forman <pete.forman@airgun.wg.waii.com>
;; for additional motif keybindings.
;; Thanks to jvromans@squirrel.nl (Johan Vromans) for a bug report
;; concerning setting of this-command.
;; Dan Nicolaescu <done@ece.arizona.ro> suggested suppressing the
;; scroll-up/scroll-down error.
;; Eli Barzilay (eli@cs.bgu.ac.il) suggested the sexps functions and
;; keybindings.
;;
;; Ok, some details about the idea of PC Selection mode:
;;
;;  o The standard keys for moving around (right, left, up, down, home, end,
;;    prior, next, called "move-keys" from now on) will always de-activate
;;    the mark.
;;  o If you press "Shift" together with the "move-keys", the region
;;    you pass along is activated
;;  o You have the copy, cut and paste functions (as in many other programs)
;;    which will operate on the active region
;;    It was not possible to bind them to C-v, C-x and C-c for obvious
;;    emacs reasons.
;;    They will be bound according to the "old" behaviour to S-delete (cut),
;;    S-insert (paste) and C-insert (copy). These keys do the same in many
;;    other programs.

This mode enables Delete Selection mode and Transient Mark mode.

The arrow keys (and others) are bound to new functions
which modify the status of the mark.

The ordinary arrow keys disable the mark.
The shift-arrow keys move, leaving the mark behind.

C-LEFT and C-RIGHT move back or forward one word, disabling the mark.
S-C-LEFT and S-C-RIGHT move back or forward one word, leaving the mark behind.

M-LEFT and M-RIGHT move back or forward one word or sexp, disabling the mark.
S-M-LEFT and S-M-RIGHT move back or forward one word or sexp, leaving the mark
behind.  To control whether these keys move word-wise or sexp-wise set the
variable `pc-select-meta-moves-sexps' after loading pc-select.el but before
turning PC Selection mode on.

C-DOWN and C-UP move back or forward a paragraph, disabling the mark.
S-C-DOWN and S-C-UP move back or forward a paragraph, leaving the mark behind.

HOME moves to beginning of line, disabling the mark.
S-HOME moves to beginning of line, leaving the mark behind.
With Ctrl or Meta, these keys move to beginning of buffer instead.

END moves to end of line, disabling the mark.
S-END moves to end of line, leaving the mark behind.
With Ctrl or Meta, these keys move to end of buffer instead.

PRIOR or PAGE-UP scrolls and disables the mark.
S-PRIOR or S-PAGE-UP scrolls and leaves the mark behind.

S-DELETE kills the region (`kill-region').
S-INSERT yanks text from the kill ring (`yank').
C-INSERT copies the region into the kill ring (`copy-region-as-kill').

In addition, certain other PC bindings are imitated (to avoid this, set
the variable `pc-select-selection-keys-only' to t after loading pc-select.el
