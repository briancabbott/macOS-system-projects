;;; Commentary:

;; The home page of the Meta-CVS version control system is at
;;
;;      http://users.footprints.net/~kaz/mcvs.html
;;
;; This is derived from vc-cvs.el as follows:
;; - cp vc-cvs.el vc-mcvs.el
;; - Replace CVS/ with MCVS/CVS/
;; - Replace 'CVS with 'MCVS
;; - Replace -cvs- with -mcvs-
;; - Replace most of the rest of CVS to Meta-CVS
;;
;; Then of course started the hacking.  Only a small part of the code
;; has been touched and not much more than that was tested, so if
;; you bump into a bug, don't be surprised: just report it to me.
;;
;; What has been partly tested:
;; - C-x v v to start editing a file that was checked out with CVSREAD on.
;; - C-x v v to commit a file
;; - C-x v =
;; - C-x v l
;; - C-x v i
;; - C-x v g
;; - M-x vc-rename-file RET

;;; Bugs:

;; - Retrieving snapshots doesn't filter `cvs update' output and thus
;;   parses bogus filenames.  Don't know if it harms.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'vc))
(require 'vc-cvs)
