;;; Commentary:

;; Provides fairly minimal font-lock, imenu and indentation support
;; for editing configure.in files.  Only Autoconf syntax is processed.
;; There is no attempt to deal with shell text -- probably that will
;; always lose.

;; This is specialized for configure.in files.  It doesn't inherit the
;; general M4 stuff from M4 mode.

;; There is also an autoconf-mode.el in existence.  That appears to be
;; for editing the Autoconf M4 source, rather than configure.in files.

;;; Code:

(defvar font-lock-syntactic-keywords)

(defvar autoconf-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))

(defvar autoconf-mode-hook nil
  "Hook run by `autoconf-mode'.")

(defconst autoconf-font-lock-syntactic-keywords

(defvar autoconf-font-lock-keywords
  `(("\\_<A[CHMS]_\\sw+" . font-lock-keyword-face)
    (,autoconf-definition-regexp
     3 font-lock-function-name-face)
    ;; Are any other M4 keywords really appropriate for configure.in,
    ;; given that we do `dnl'?
    ("changequote" . font-lock-keyword-face)))
