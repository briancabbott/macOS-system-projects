;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the compile facilities documented in the Emacs user's
;; manual.

;; This mode uses some complex data-structures:

;;   LOC (or location) is a list of (COLUMN LINE FILE-STRUCTURE)

;; COLUMN and LINE are numbers parsed from an error message.  COLUMN and maybe
;; LINE will be nil for a message that doesn't contain them.  Then the
;; location refers to a indented beginning of line or beginning of file.
;; Once any location in some file has been jumped to, the list is extended to
;; (COLUMN LINE FILE-STRUCTURE MARKER . VISITED) for all LOCs pertaining to
;; that file.
;; MARKER initially points to LINE and COLUMN in a buffer visiting that file.
;; Being a marker it sticks to some text, when the buffer grows or shrinks
;; before that point.  VISITED is t if we have jumped there, else nil.

;;   FILE-STRUCTURE is a list of
;;   ((FILENAME . DIRECTORY) FORMATS (LINE LOC ...) ...)

;; FILENAME is a string parsed from an error message.  DIRECTORY is a string
;; obtained by following directory change messages.  DIRECTORY will be nil for
;; an absolute filename.  FORMATS is a list of formats to apply to FILENAME if
;; a file of that name can't be found.
;; The rest of the list is an alist of elements with LINE as key.  The keys
;; are either nil or line numbers.  If present, nil comes first, followed by
;; the numbers in decreasing order.  The LOCs for each line are again an alist
;; ordered the same way.  Note that the whole file structure is referenced in
;; every LOC.

;;   MESSAGE is a list of (LOC TYPE END-LOC)

;; TYPE is 0 for info or 1 for warning if the message matcher identified it as
;; such, 2 otherwise (for a real error).  END-LOC is a LOC pointing to the
;; other end, if the parsed message contained a range.  If the end of the
;; range didn't specify a COLUMN, it defaults to -1, meaning end of line.
;; These are the value of the `message' text-properties in the compilation
;; buffer.

  "Alist that specifies how to match errors in compiler output.
On GNU and Unix, any string is a valid filename, so these
matchers must make some common sense assumptions, which catch
normal cases.  A shorter list will be lighter on resource usage.

Instead of an alist element, you can use a symbol, which is
looked up in `compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist'.  You can see
the predefined symbols and their effects in the file
`etc/compilation.txt' (linked below if you are customizing this).

Each elt has the form (REGEXP FILE [LINE COLUMN TYPE HYPERLINK
HIGHLIGHT...]).  If REGEXP matches, the FILE'th subexpression
gives the file name, and the LINE'th subexpression gives the line
number.  The COLUMN'th subexpression gives the column number on
that line.

If FILE, LINE or COLUMN are nil or that index didn't match, that
information is not present on the matched line.  In that case the
file name is assumed to be the same as the previous one in the
buffer, line number defaults to 1 and column defaults to
beginning of line's indentation.

FILE can also have the form (FILE FORMAT...), where the FORMATs
\(e.g. \"%s.c\") will be applied in turn to the recognized file
name, until a file of that name is found.  Or FILE can also be a
function that returns (FILENAME) or (RELATIVE-FILENAME . DIRNAME).
In the former case, FILENAME may be relative or absolute.

LINE can also be of the form (LINE . END-LINE) meaning a range
of lines.  COLUMN can also be of the form (COLUMN . END-COLUMN)
meaning a range of columns starting on LINE and ending on
END-LINE, if that matched.

TYPE is 2 or nil for a real error or 1 for warning or 0 for info.
TYPE can also be of the form (WARNING . INFO).  In that case this
will be equivalent to 1 if the WARNING'th subexpression matched
or else equivalent to 0 if the INFO'th subexpression matched.
See `compilation-error-face', `compilation-warning-face',
`compilation-info-face' and `compilation-skip-threshold'.

What matched the HYPERLINK'th subexpression has `mouse-face' and
`compilation-message-face' applied.  If this is nil, the text
matched by the whole REGEXP becomes the hyperlink.

Additional HIGHLIGHTs as described under `font-lock-keywords' can
be added."
