  "Alist of symbols vs integer codes of glyph reference points.
A glyph reference point symbol is to be used to specify a composition
rule in COMPONENTS argument to such functions as `compose-region' and
`make-composition'.

Meanings of glyph reference point codes are as follows:

    0----1----2 <---- ascent	0:tl or top-left
    |         |			1:tc or top-center
    |         |			2:tr or top-right
    |         |			3:Bl or base-left     9:cl or center-left
    9   10   11 <---- center	4:Bc or base-center  10:cc or center-center
    |         |			5:Br or base-right   11:cr or center-right
  --3----4----5-- <-- baseline	6:bl or bottom-left
    |         |			7:bc or bottom-center
    6----7----8 <---- descent	8:br or bottom-right

Glyph reference point symbols are to be used to specify composition
rule of the form \(GLOBAL-REF-POINT . NEW-REF-POINT), where
GLOBAL-REF-POINT is a reference point in the overall glyphs already
composed, and NEW-REF-POINT is a reference point in the new glyph to
be added.

For instance, if GLOBAL-REF-POINT is `br' (bottom-right) and
NEW-REF-POINT is `tc' (top-center), the overall glyph is updated as
follows (the point `*' corresponds to both reference points):

    +-------+--+ <--- new ascent
    |       |  |
    | global|  |
    | glyph |  |
 -- |       |  |-- <--- baseline \(doesn't change)
    +----+--*--+
    |    | new |
    |    |glyph|
    +----+-----+ <--- new descent
