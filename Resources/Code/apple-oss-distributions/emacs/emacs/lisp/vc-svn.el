;;; Commentary:

;; This is preliminary support for Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/).
;; It started as `sed s/cvs/svn/ vc.cvs.el' (from version 1.56)
;; and hasn't been completely fixed since.

;; Sync'd with Subversion's vc-svn.el as of revision 5801.

;;; Bugs:

;; - VC-dired is (really) slow.

;;; Code:

  (require 'vc))
