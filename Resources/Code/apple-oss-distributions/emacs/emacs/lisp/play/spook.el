;;; Commentary:

;; Steve Strassmann <straz@media-lab.media.mit.edu> didn't write
;; this, and even if he did, he really didn't mean for you to use it
;; in an anarchistic way.
;;
;; To use this:
;;  Just before sending mail, do M-x spook.
;;  A number of phrases will be inserted into your buffer, to help
;;  give your message that extra bit of attractiveness for automated
;;  keyword scanners.  Help defeat the NSA trunk trawler!
