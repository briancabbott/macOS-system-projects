;;; Commentary:
;;; Lm is a relatively non-participatory game in which a robot
;;; attempts to maneuver towards a tree at the center of the window
;;; based on unique olfactory cues from each of the 4 directions. If
;;; the smell of the tree increases, then the weights in the robot's
;;; brain are adjusted to encourage this odor-driven behavior in the
;;; future. If the smell of the tree decreases, the robots weights are
;;; adjusted to discourage a correct move.

;;; In laymen's terms, the search space is initially flat. The point
;;; of training is to "turn up the edges of the search space" so that
;;; the robot rolls toward the center.

;;; Further, do not become alarmed if the robot appears to oscillate
;;; back and forth between two or a few positions. This simply means
;;; it is currently caught in a local minimum and is doing its best to
;;; work its way out.

;;; The version of this program as described has a small problem. a
;;; move in a net direction can produce gross credit assignment. for
;;; example, if moving south will produce positive payoff, then, if in
;;; a single move, one moves east,west and south, then both east and
;;; west will be improved when they shouldn't

;;; Many thanks to Yuri Pryadkin (yuri@rana.usc.edu) for this
;;; concise problem description.

;; The board is a rectangular grid. We code empty squares with 0, X's with 1

;; detect when we are trying to move out of the board.  We denote a square by
;; its (X,Y) coords, or by the INDEX corresponding to them in the vector.  The
;; leftmost topmost square has coords (1,1) and index lm-board-width + 2.
;; Similarly, vectors between squares may be given by two DX, DY coords or by
;; one DEPL (the difference between indexes).

;;;_ +  THE SCORE TABLE.


;; Every (free) square has a score associated to it, recorded in the
;; LM-SCORE-TABLE vector. The program always plays in the square having
;; the highest score.

(defvar lm-score-table nil
  "Vector recording the actual score of the free squares.")


;; The key point point about the algorithm is that, rather than considering
;; the board as just a set of squares, we prefer to see it as a "space" of
;; internested 5-tuples of contiguous squares (called qtuples).
;;
;; The aim of the program is to fill one qtuple with its O's while preventing
;; you from filling another one with your X's. To that effect, it computes a
;; score for every qtuple, with better qtuples having better scores. Of
;; course, the score of a qtuple (taken in isolation) is just determined by
;; its contents as a set, i.e. not considering the order of its elements. The
;; highest score is given to the "OOOO" qtuples because playing in such a
;; qtuple is winning the game. Just after this comes the "XXXX" qtuple because
;; not playing in it is just loosing the game, and so on. Note that a
;; "polluted" qtuple, i.e. one containing at least one X and at least one O,
;; has score zero because there is no more any point in playing in it, from
;; both an attacking and a defending point of view.
;;
;; Given the score of every qtuple, the score of a given free square on the
;; board is just the sum of the scores of all the qtuples to which it belongs,
;; because playing in that square is playing in all its containing qtuples at
;; once. And it is that function which takes into account the internesting of
;; the qtuples.
;;
;; This algorithm is rather simple but anyway it gives a not so dumb level of
;; play. It easily extends to "n-dimensional Lm", where a win should not
;; be obtained with as few as 5 contiguous marks: 6 or 7 (depending on n !)
;; should be preferred.


;; Here are the scores of the nine "non-polluted" configurations.  Tuning
;; these values will change (hopefully improve) the strength of the program
;; and may change its style (rather aggressive here).

(defconst nil-score	  7  "Score of an empty qtuple.")
(defconst Xscore	 15  "Score of a qtuple containing one X.")
(defconst XXscore	400  "Score of a qtuple containing two X's.")
(defconst XXXscore     1800  "Score of a qtuple containing three X's.")
(defconst XXXXscore  100000  "Score of a qtuple containing four X's.")
(defconst Oscore	 35  "Score of a qtuple containing one O.")
(defconst OOscore	800  "Score of a qtuple containing two O's.")
(defconst OOOscore    15000  "Score of a qtuple containing three O's.")
(defconst OOOOscore  800000  "Score of a qtuple containing four O's.")

;; These values are not just random: if, given the following situation:
;;
;;			  . . . . . . . O .
;;			  . X X a . . . X .
;;			  . . . X . . . X .
;;			  . . . X . . . X .
;;			  . . . . . . . b .
;;
;; you want Emacs to play in "a" and not in "b", then the parameters must
;; satisfy the inequality:
;;
;;		   6 * XXscore > XXXscore + XXscore
;;
;; because "a" mainly belongs to six "XX" qtuples (the others are less
;; important) while "b" belongs to one "XXX" and one "XX" qtuples.  Other
;; conditions are required to obtain sensible moves, but the previous example
;; should illustrate the point. If you manage to improve on these values,
;; please send me a note. Thanks.


;; As we chose values 0, 1 and 6 to denote empty, X and O squares, the
;; contents of a qtuple are uniquely determined by the sum of its elements and
;; we just have to set up a translation table.
