;;; Commentary:

;; (animate-string STRING VPOS &optional HPOS)
;; makes the string STRING appear starting at VPOS, HPOS
;; by having each letter swoop into place from random starting position.

;; animate-birthday-present was the first application of this program.

;;; Code:

;;; STRING is the string to be displayed,
;;; and DEST-X, DEST-Y say where on the screen
;;; it should end up.

;;; This function returns a list describing
;;; all the characters and the paths they should take.
;;; Each element has the form
;;;  (CHAR START-Y START-X DEST-Y DEST-X).

;;; The start position of each character is chosen randomly.
;;; The destination is chosen to put it in the right place
;;; in the string when the whole string finally reaches its
;;; specified position.

			(random (window-height))
			(random (1- (window-width)))
			;; All the chars should end up
			;; on the specified line.
			vpos
			;; The Ith character in the string
			;; needs to end up I positions later.
			(+ hpos i))
		  characters)))

;;; Display the characters in CHARACTERS,
;;; each one FRACTION of the way from its start to its destination.
;;; If FRACTION is 0, the characters appear in their starting positions.
;;; If FRACTION is 1, the characters appear in their destinations.
