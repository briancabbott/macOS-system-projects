;;; Commentary:

;;
;; appt.el - visible and/or audible notification of
;;           appointments from diary file.
;;
;;;
;;; Thanks to  Edward M. Reingold for much help and many suggestions,
;;; And to many others for bug fixes and suggestions.
;;;
;;;
;;; This functions in this file will alert the user of a
;;; pending appointment based on his/her diary file.  This package
;;; is documented in the Emacs manual.
;;;
;;; To activate this package, simply use (appt-activate 1).
;;; A `diary-file' with appointments of the format described in the
;;; documentation of the function `appt-check' is required.
;;; Relevant customizable variables are also listed in the
;;; documentation of that function.
;;;
;;; Today's appointment list is initialized from the diary when this
;;; package is activated. Additionally, the appointments list is
;;; recreated automatically at 12:01am for those who do not logout
;;; every day or are programming late. It is also updated when the
;;; `diary-file' is saved. Calling `appt-check' with an argument forces
;;; a re-initialization at any time.
;;;
;;; In order to add or delete items from today's list, without
;;; changing the diary file, use `appt-add' and `appt-delete'.
;;;

;;; Brief internal description - Skip this if you are not interested!
;;;
;;; The function `appt-make-list' creates the appointments list which
;;; `appt-check' reads.
;;;
;;; You can change the way the appointment window is created/deleted by
;;; setting the variables
;;;
;;;	     appt-disp-window-function
;;; and
;;; 	     appt-delete-window-function
;;;
;;; For instance, these variables could be set to functions that display
;;; appointments in pop-up frames, which are lowered or iconified after
;;; `appt-display-interval' minutes.
;;;

;;; Code:

;; Make sure calendar is loaded when we compile this.

`appt-audible'

`appt-message-warning-time'
	Variable used to determine when appointment message

`appt-display-mode-line'
        If non-nil, a generic message giving the time remaining
        is shown in the mode-line when an appointment is due.

`appt-display-interval'
        Interval in minutes at which to check for pending appointments.

`appt-display-diary'
        Display the diary buffer when the appointment list is
        initialized for the first time in a day.

The following variables are only relevant if reminders are being
displayed in a window:

`appt-display-duration'
	The number of seconds an appointment message is displayed.

`appt-disp-window-function'
    	Function called to display appointment window.

`appt-delete-window-function'

;; In Emacs-21.3, the manual documented the following procedure to
;; activate this package:
;;     (display-time)
;;     (add-hook 'diary-hook 'appt-make-list)
;;     (diary 0)
;; The display-time call was not necessary, AFAICS.
;; What was really needed was to add the hook and load this file.
;; Calling (diary 0) once the hook had been added was in some sense a
;; roundabout way of loading this file. This file used to have code at
;; the top-level that set up the appt-timer and global-mode-string.
;; One way to maintain backwards compatibility would be to call
;; (appt-activate 1) at top-level. However, this goes against the
;; convention that just loading an Emacs package should not activate
;; it. Instead, we make appt-make-list activate the package (after a
;; suggestion from rms). This means that one has to call diary in
;; order to get it to work, but that is in line with the old (weird,
;; IMO) documented behavior for activating the package.
;; Actually, since (diary 0) does not run diary-hook, I don't think
;; the documented behavior in Emacs-21.3 would ever have worked.
;; Oh well, at least with the changes to appt-make-list it will now
;; work as well as it ever did.
;; The new method is just to use (appt-activate 1).
