;;; Commentary:

;; This collection of functions implements a calendar window.  It
;; generates a calendar for the current month, together with the
;; previous and coming months, or for any other three-month period.
;; The calendar can be scrolled forward and backward in the window to
;; show months in the past or future; the cursor can move forward and
;; backward by days, weeks, or months, making it possible, for
;; instance, to jump to the date a specified number of days, weeks, or
;; months from the date under the cursor.  The user can display a list
;; of holidays and other notable days for the period shown; the
;; notable days can be marked on the calendar, if desired.  The user
;; can also specify that dates having corresponding diary entries (in
;; a file that the user specifies) be marked; the diary entries for
;; any date can be viewed in a separate window.  The diary and the
;; notable days can be viewed independently of the calendar.  Dates
;; can be translated from the (usual) Gregorian calendar to the day of
;; the year/days remaining in year, to the ISO commercial calendar, to
;; the Julian (old style) calendar, to the Hebrew calendar, to the
;; Islamic calendar, to the Baha'i calendar, to the French
;; Revolutionary calendar, to the Mayan calendar, to the Chinese
;; calendar, to the Coptic calendar, to the Ethiopic calendar, and to
;; the astronomical (Julian) day number.  When floating point is
;; available, times of sunrise/sunset can be displayed, as can the
;; phases of the moon.  Appointment notification for diary entries is
;; available.  Calendar printing via LaTeX is available.

;; The following files are part of the calendar/diary code:

;;       appt.el                       Appointment notification
;;       cal-china.el                  Chinese calendar

(defcustom diary-file "~/diary"
  "Name of the file in which one's personal diary of dates is kept.

The file's entries are lines beginning with any of the forms
specified by the variable `american-date-diary-pattern', by default:

            MONTH/DAY
            MONTH/DAY/YEAR
            MONTHNAME DAY
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR
            DAYNAME

with the remainder of the line being the diary entry string for
that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is a
number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two
digits (if `abbreviated-calendar-year' is non-nil).  MONTHNAME
and DAYNAME can be spelled in full (as specified by the variables
`calendar-month-name-array' and `calendar-day-name-array'),
abbreviated (as specified by `calendar-month-abbrev-array' and
`calendar-day-abbrev-array') with or without a period,
capitalized or not.  Any of DAY, MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be
`*' which matches any day, month, or year, respectively. If the
date does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any
year.  A DAYNAME entry applies to the appropriate day of the week
in every week.

The European style (in which the day precedes the month) can be
used instead, if you execute `european-calendar' when in the
calendar, or set `european-calendar-style' to t in your .emacs
file.  The European forms (see `european-date-diary-pattern') are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

To revert to the default American style from the European style, execute
`american-calendar' in the calendar.

A diary entry can be preceded by the character
`diary-nonmarking-symbol' (ordinarily `&') to make that entry
nonmarking--that is, it will not be marked on dates in the calendar
window but will appear in a diary window.

Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with
either a TAB or one or more spaces.

Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary
entries (in the default American style):

     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!
     &1/1. Happy New Year!
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.
     21: Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89 Friday the thirteenth!!
     &thu 4pm squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16 Dad's birthday
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.
     &* 15 time cards due.

If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line is not displayed in the
diary window; only the continuation lines is shown.  For example, the
single diary entry

     02/11/1989
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School

will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if
used with more than one day's entries displayed.

Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry

      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation

causes the diary entry \"Vacation\" to appear from November 1 through
November 10, 1990.  Other functions available are `diary-float',
`diary-anniversary', `diary-cyclic', `diary-day-of-year',
`diary-iso-date', `diary-french-date', `diary-hebrew-date',
`diary-islamic-date', `diary-bahai-date', `diary-mayan-date',
`diary-chinese-date', `diary-coptic-date', `diary-ethiopic-date',
`diary-persian-date', `diary-yahrzeit', `diary-sunrise-sunset',
`diary-phases-of-moon', `diary-parasha', `diary-omer',
`diary-rosh-hodesh', and `diary-sabbath-candles'.  See the
documentation for the function `list-sexp-diary-entries' for more
details.

Diary entries based on the Hebrew, the Islamic and/or the Baha'i
calendar are also possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they
are ignored unless you set the `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' and
the `nongregorian-diary-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the
documentation for these functions for details.

Diary files can contain directives to include the contents of other files; for

The matching of the diary entries with the date forms is done with the
standard syntax table from Fundamental mode, but with the `*' changed so
that it is a word constituent.

If, to be mutually exclusive, a pseudo-pattern must match a portion of the
diary entry itself, the first element of the pattern MUST be `backup'.  This
directive causes the date recognizer to back up to the beginning of the
current word of the diary entry, so in no case can the pattern match more than
a portion of the first word of the diary entry."

  "List of notable days for the command \\[holidays].

Additional holidays are easy to add to the list, just put them in the
list `other-holidays' in your .emacs file.  Similarly, by setting any
of `general-holidays', `local-holidays' `christian-holidays',
`hebrew-holidays', `islamic-holidays', `bahai-holidays',
`oriental-holidays', or `solar-holidays' to nil in your .emacs file,
you can eliminate unwanted categories of holidays.

The aforementioned variables control the holiday choices offered
by the function `list-holidays' when it is called interactively.

They also initialize the default value of `calendar-holidays',
which is the default list of holidays used by the function
`list-holidays' in the non-interactive case.  Note that these
variables have no effect on `calendar-holidays' after it has been
set (e.g. after the calendar is loaded).  In that case, customize
`calendar-holidays' directly.

The intention is that (in the US) `local-holidays' be set in
site-init.el and `other-holidays' be set by the user.

Entries on the list are expressions that return (possibly empty) lists of
items of the form ((month day year) string) of a holiday in the in the
three-month period centered around `displayed-month' of `displayed-year'.
Several basic functions are provided for this purpose:

    (holiday-fixed MONTH DAY STRING) is a fixed date on the Gregorian calendar
    (holiday-float MONTH DAYNAME K STRING &optional day) is the Kth DAYNAME in
                               MONTH on the Gregorian calendar (0 for Sunday,
                               etc.); K<0 means count back from the end of the
                               month.  An optional parameter DAY means the Kth
                               DAYNAME after/before MONTH DAY.
    (holiday-hebrew MONTH DAY STRING)  a fixed date on the Hebrew calendar
    (holiday-islamic MONTH DAY STRING) a fixed date on the Islamic calendar
    (holiday-bahai MONTH DAY STRING)   a fixed date on the Baha'i calendar
    (holiday-julian MONTH DAY STRING)  a fixed date on the Julian calendar
    (holiday-sexp SEXP STRING) SEXP is a Gregorian-date-valued expression
                               in the variable `year'; if it evaluates to
                               a visible date, that's the holiday; if it
                               evaluates to nil, there's no holiday.  STRING
                               is an expression in the variable `date'.

For example, to add Bastille Day, celebrated in France on July 14, add

     (holiday-fixed 7 14 \"Bastille Day\")

to the list.  To add Hurricane Supplication Day, celebrated in the Virgin
Islands on the fourth Monday in August, add

     (holiday-float 8 1 4 \"Hurricane Supplication Day\")

to the list (the last Monday would be specified with `-1' instead of `4').
To add the last day of Hanukkah to the list, use

     (holiday-hebrew 10 2 \"Last day of Hanukkah\")

since the Hebrew months are numbered with 1 starting from Nisan, while to
add the Islamic feast celebrating Mohammed's birthday use

     (holiday-islamic 3 12 \"Mohammed's Birthday\")

since the Islamic months are numbered from 1 starting with Muharram.  To
add an entry for the Baha'i festival of Ridvan, use

     (holiday-bahai 2 13 \"Festival of Ridvan\")

since the Baha'i months are numbered from 1 starting with Baha.  To
add Thomas Jefferson's birthday, April 2, 1743 (Julian), use

     (holiday-julian 4 2 \"Jefferson's Birthday\")

To include a holiday conditionally, use the sexp form or a conditional.  For
example, to include American presidential elections, which occur on the first
Tuesday after the first Monday in November of years divisible by 4, add

     (holiday-sexp
       '(if (zerop (% year 4))
           (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
             (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before
                   1 (+ 6 (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                            (list 11 1 year)))))))
       \"US Presidential Election\")

or

     (if (zerop (% displayed-year 4))
         (holiday-fixed 11
                (extract-calendar-day
                 (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
                  (1+ (calendar-dayname-on-or-before

                \"US Presidential Election\"))

to the list.  To include the phases of the moon, add

     (lunar-phases)

to the holiday list, where `lunar-phases' is an Emacs-Lisp function that
you've written to return a (possibly empty) list of the relevant VISIBLE dates
with descriptive strings such as

     (((2 6 1989) \"New Moon\") ((2 12 1989) \"First Quarter Moon\") ... )."

Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar can be scrolled forward

The cursor can be moved forward or backward by one day, one week, one month,

every time the calendar window gets scrolled, if the current date is visible
