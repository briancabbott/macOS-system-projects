A ChangeLog paragraph is a bunch of log text containing no blank lines;
a paragraph usually describes a set of changes with a single purpose,
but perhaps spanning several functions in several files.  Changes in
different paragraphs are unrelated.

You could argue that the log entry for a file should contain the
full ChangeLog paragraph mentioning the change to the file, even though
it may mention other files, because that gives you the full context you
need to understand the change.  This is the behavior you get when this
variable is set to t.

On the other hand, you could argue that the log entry for a change
should contain only the text for the changes which occurred in that
file, because the log is per-file.  This is the behavior you get
when this variable is set to nil.")
