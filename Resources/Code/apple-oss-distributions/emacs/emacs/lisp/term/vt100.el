;;; Commentary:

;; Uses the Emacs 19 terminal initialization features --- won't work with 18.

;; Handles all VT100 clones, including the Apollo terminal.  Also handles
;; the VT200 --- its PF- and arrow- keys are different, but all those
;; are really set up by the terminal initialization code, which mines them
;; out of termcap.  This package is here to define the keypad comma, dash
;; and period (which aren't in termcap's repertoire) and the function for
;; changing from 80 to 132 columns & vv.

;;; Code:

;; Set up function-key-map entries that termcap and terminfo don't know.
