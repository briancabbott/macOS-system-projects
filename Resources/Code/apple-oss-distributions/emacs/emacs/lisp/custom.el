;; This file only contains the code needed to declare and initialize
;; user options.  The code to customize options is autoloaded from
;; `cus-edit.el' and is documented in the Emacs Lisp Reference manual.

;; The code implementing face declarations is in `cus-face.el'.

  "Declare SYMBOL as a customizable variable that defaults to VALUE.
DOC is the variable documentation.

Neither SYMBOL nor VALUE need to be quoted.
If SYMBOL is not already bound, initialize it to VALUE.
The remaining arguments should have the form

   [KEYWORD VALUE]...

The following keywords are meaningful:

:type	VALUE should be a widget type for editing the symbol's value.
:options VALUE should be a list of valid members of the widget type.
:initialize
	VALUE should be a function used to initialize the
	variable.  It takes two arguments, the symbol and value
	given in the `defcustom' call.  The default is
	`custom-initialize-reset'.
:set	VALUE should be a function to set the value of the symbol.
	It takes two arguments, the symbol to set and the value to
	give it.  The default choice of function is `set-default'.
:get	VALUE should be a function to extract the value of symbol.
	The function takes one argument, a symbol, and should return
	the current value for that symbol.  The default choice of function
	is `default-value'.
:require
	VALUE should be a feature symbol.  If you save a value
	for this option, then when your `.emacs' file loads the value,
	it does (require VALUE) first.

The following common keywords are also meaningful.

:group  VALUE should be a customization group.
        Add SYMBOL (or FACE with `defface') to that group.
:link LINK-DATA
        Include an external link after the documentation string for this
        item.  This is a sentence containing an active field which
        references some other documentation.

        There are several alternatives you can use for LINK-DATA:

        (custom-manual INFO-NODE)
             Link to an Info node; INFO-NODE is a string which specifies
             the node name, as in \"(emacs)Top\".

        (info-link INFO-NODE)
             Like `custom-manual' except that the link appears in the
             customization buffer with the Info node name.

        (url-link URL)
             Link to a web page; URL is a string which specifies the URL.

        (emacs-commentary-link LIBRARY)
             Link to the commentary section of LIBRARY.

        (emacs-library-link LIBRARY)
             Link to an Emacs Lisp LIBRARY file.

        (file-link FILE)
             Link to FILE.

        (function-link FUNCTION)
             Link to the documentation of FUNCTION.

        (variable-link VARIABLE)
             Link to the documentation of VARIABLE.

        (custom-group-link GROUP)
             Link to another customization GROUP.

        You can specify the text to use in the customization buffer by
        adding `:tag NAME' after the first element of the LINK-DATA; for
        example, (info-link :tag \"foo\" \"(emacs)Top\") makes a link to the
        Emacs manual which appears in the buffer as `foo'.

        An item can have more than one external link; however, most items
        have none at all.
:version
        VALUE should be a string specifying that the variable was
        first introduced, or its default value was changed, in Emacs
        version VERSION.
:package-version
        VALUE should be a list with the form (PACKAGE . VERSION)
        specifying that the variable was first introduced, or its
        default value was changed, in PACKAGE version VERSION.  This
        keyword takes priority over :version.  The PACKAGE and VERSION
        must appear in the alist `customize-package-emacs-version-alist'.
        Since PACKAGE must be unique and the user might see it in an
        error message, a good choice is the official name of the
        package, such as MH-E or Gnus.
:tag LABEL
        Use LABEL, a string, instead of the item's name, to label the item
        in customization menus and buffers.
:load FILE
        Load file FILE (a string) before displaying this customization
        item.  Loading is done with `load', and only if the file is
        not already loaded.
:set-after VARIABLES
	Specifies that SYMBOL should be set after the list of variables
        VARIABLES when both have been customized.

If SYMBOL has a local binding, then this form affects the local
binding.  This is normally not what you want.  Thus, if you need
to load a file defining variables with this form, or with
`defvar' or `defconst', you should always load that file
_outside_ any bindings for these variables.  \(`defvar' and
`defconst' behave similarly in this respect.)

See Info node `(elisp) Customization' in the Emacs Lisp manual
for more information."

;;; The `defface' Macro.

(defmacro defface (face spec doc &rest args)
  "Declare FACE as a customizable face that defaults to SPEC.
FACE does not need to be quoted.

Third argument DOC is the face documentation.

If FACE has been set with `custom-set-faces', set the face attributes
as specified by that function, otherwise set the face attributes
according to SPEC.

The remaining arguments should have the form

   [KEYWORD VALUE]...

For a list of valid keywords, see the common keywords listed in
`defcustom'.

SPEC should be an alist of the form ((DISPLAY ATTS)...).

In the first element, DISPLAY can be `default'.  The ATTS in that
element then act as defaults for all the following elements.

Aside from that, DISPLAY specifies conditions to match some or
all frames.  For each frame, the first element of SPEC where the
DISPLAY conditions are satisfied is the one that applies to that
frame.  The ATTRs in this element take effect, and the following
elements are ignored, on that frame.

In the last element, DISPLAY can be t.  That element applies to a
frame if none of the previous elements (except the `default' if
any) did.

ATTS is a list of face attributes followed by their values:
  (ATTR VALUE ATTR VALUE...)

The possible attributes are `:family', `:width', `:height', `:weight',
`:slant', `:underline', `:overline', `:strike-through', `:box',
`:foreground', `:background', `:stipple', `:inverse-video', and `:inherit'.

DISPLAY can be `default' (only in the first element), the symbol
t (only in the last element) to match all frames, or an alist of
conditions of the form \(REQ ITEM...).  For such an alist to
match a frame, each of the conditions must be satisfied, meaning
that the REQ property of the frame must match one of the
corresponding ITEMs.  These are the defined REQ values:

`type' (the value of `window-system')
  Under X, in addition to the values `window-system' can take,
  `motif', `lucid', `gtk' and `x-toolkit' are allowed, and match when
  the Motif toolkit, Lucid toolkit, GTK toolkit or any X toolkit is in use.

`class' (the frame's color support)
  Should be one of `color', `grayscale', or `mono'.

`background' (what color is used for the background text)
  Should be one of `light' or `dark'.

`min-colors' (the minimum number of colors the frame should support)
  Should be an integer, it is compared with the result of
  `display-color-cells'.

`supports' (only match frames that support the specified face attributes)
  Should be a list of face attributes.  See the documentation for
  the function `display-supports-face-attributes-p' for more
  information on exactly how testing is done.

;;; Custom Themes

;; Custom themes are collections of settings that can be enabled or
;; disabled as a unit.

;; Each Custom theme is defined by a symbol, called the theme name.
;; The `theme-settings' property of the theme name records the
;; variable and face settings of the theme.  This property is a list
;; of elements, each of the form
;;
;;     (PROP SYMBOL THEME VALUE)
;;
;;  - PROP is either `theme-value' or `theme-face'
;;  - SYMBOL is the face or variable name
;;  - THEME is the theme name (redundant, but simplifies the code)
;;  - VALUE is an expression that gives the theme's setting for SYMBOL.
;;
;; The theme name also has a `theme-feature' property, whose value is
;; specified when the theme is defined (see `custom-declare-theme').
;; Usually, this is just a symbol named THEME-theme.  This lets
;; external libraries call (require 'foo-theme).

;; In addition, each symbol (either a variable or a face) affected by
;; an *enabled* theme has a `theme-value' or `theme-face' property,
;; which is a list of elements each of the form
;;
;;     (THEME VALUE)
;;
;; which have the same meanings as in `theme-settings'.
;;
;; The `theme-value' and `theme-face' lists are ordered by decreasing
;; theme precedence.  Thus, the first element is always the one that
;; is in effect.

;; Each theme is stored in a theme file, with filename THEME-theme.el.
;; Loading a theme basically involves calling (load "THEME-theme")
;; This is done by the function `load-theme'.  Loading a theme
;; automatically enables it.
;;
;; When a theme is enabled, the `theme-value' and `theme-face'
;; properties for the affected symbols are set.  When a theme is
;; disabled, its settings are removed from the `theme-value' and
;; `theme-face' properties, but the theme's own `theme-settings'
;; property remains unchanged.
