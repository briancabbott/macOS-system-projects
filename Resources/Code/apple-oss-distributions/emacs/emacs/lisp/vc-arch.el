;;; Commentary:

;; The home page of the Arch version control system is at
;;
;;      http://www.gnuarch.org/
;;
;; This is derived from vc-mcvs.el as follows:
;; - cp vc-mcvs.el vc-arch.el and then M-% mcvs RET arch RET
;;
;; Then of course started the hacking.
;;
;; What has been partly tested:
;; - Open a file.
;; - C-x v =  without any prefix arg.
;; - C-x v v  to commit a change to a single file.

;; Bugs:

;; - *VC-log*'s initial content lacks the `Summary:' lines.
;; - All files under the tree are considered as "under Arch's control"
;;   without regards to =tagging-method and such.
;; - Files are always considered as `edited'.
;; - C-x v l does not work.
;; - C-x v i does not work.
;; - C-x v ~ does not work.
;; - C-x v u does not work.
;; - C-x v s does not work.
;; - C-x v r does not work.
;; - VC-dired does not work.
;; - And more...
