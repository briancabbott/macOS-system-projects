;;; Commentary:

;; This package can be used to arrange for automatic uncompress of
;; compressed files when they are visited.
;; All that's necessary is to load it.  This can conveniently be done from
;; your .emacs file.

;; M-x auto-compression-mode is a more modern replacement for this package.

;;; Code:

;; When we are about to make a backup file,
;; uncompress the file we visited
;; so that making the backup can work properly.
;; This is used as a write-file-hook.
