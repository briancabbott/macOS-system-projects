;;; Change Log:

;; moved posting and mail code from rnews.el
;;	tower@gnu.org Wed Oct 29 1986
;; brought posting code almost up to the revision of RFC 850 for News 2.11
;; - couldn't see handling the special meaning of the Keyword: poster
;; - not worth the code space to support the old A news Title: (which
;;   Subject: replaced) and Article-I.D.: (which Message-ID: replaced)
;;	tower@gnu.org Nov 86
;; changed C-c C-r key-binding due to rename of news-caesar-buffer-body
;;	tower@gnu.org 21 Nov 86
;; added (require 'rnews)	tower@gnu.org 22 Apr 87
;; restricted call of news-show-all-headers in news-post-news & news-reply
;;	tower@gnu.org 28 Apr 87
;; commented out Posting-Front-End to save USENET bytes tower@gnu.org Jul 31 87
;; commented out -n and -t args in news-inews     tower@gnu.org 15 Oct 87

;Now in paths.el.
;(defvar news-inews-program "inews"
;  "Function to post news.")

;; Replying and posting news items are done by these functions.
;; imported from rmail and modified to work with rnews ...
;; Mon Mar 25,1985 at 03:07:04 ads@mit-hermes.
;; this is done so that rnews can operate independently from rmail.el and
;; sendmail and doesn't have to autoload these functions.

;;; >> Nuked by Mly to autoload those functions again, as the duplication of
