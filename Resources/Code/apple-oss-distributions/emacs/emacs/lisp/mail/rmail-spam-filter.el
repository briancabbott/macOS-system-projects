;;; Commentary:
;;; -----------

;;; Automatically recognize and delete junk email before it is
;;; displayed in rmail/rmail-summary.  Spam emails are defined by
;;; specifying one or more of the sender, subject and contents.
;;; URL: http://www.weizmann.ac.il/~eli/Downloads/rmail-spam-filter/

;;; Usage:
;;; ------

;;; put in your .emacs:

;;; (load "rmail-spam-filter.el")

;;; and use customize (in rmail-spam-filter group) to:

;;; (*) turn on the variable rmail-use-spam-filter,

;;; (*) specify in variable rsf-definitions-alist what sender,
;;; subject and contents make an email be considered spam.

;;; in addition, you may:

;;; (*) Block future mail with the subject or sender of a message
;;; while reading it in RMAIL: just click on the "Spam" item on the
;;; menubar, and add the subject or sender to the list of spam
;;; definitions using the mouse and the appropriate menu item. You
;;; need to later also save the list of spam definitions using the
;;; same menu item, or alternatively, see variable
;;; `rsf-autosave-newly-added-definitions'.

;;; (*) specify if blind-cc'ed mail (no "To:" header field) is to be
;;; treated as spam (variable rsf-no-blind-cc; Thanks to Ethan
;;; Brown <ethan@gso.saic.com> for this).

;;; (*) specify if rmail-spam-filter should ignore case of spam
;;; definitions (variable rsf-ignore-case; Thanks to
;;; Ethan Brown <ethan@gso.saic.com> for the suggestion).

;;; (*) Specify a "white-list" of trusted senders. If any
;;; rsf-white-list string matches a substring of the "From"
;;; header, the message is flagged as a valid, non-spam message (Ethan
;;; Brown <ethan@gso.saic.com>).

;;; (*) rmail-spam-filter is best used with a general purpose spam
;;; filter such as the procmail-based http://www.spambouncer.org/.
;;; Spambouncer is set to only mark messages as spam/blocked/bulk/OK
;;; via special headers, and these headers may then be defined in
;;; rmail-spam-filter such that the spam is rejected by
;;; rmail-spam-filter itself.

;;; (*) rmail spam filter also works with bbdb to prevent spam senders
;;; from entering into the .bbdb file.  See variable
;;; "rsf-auto-delete-spam-bbdb-entries".  This is done
;;; in two ways: (a) bbdb is made not to auto-create entries for
;;; messages that are deleted by the rmail-spam-filter, (b) when a
;;; message is deleted in rmail, the user is offered to delete the
;;; sender's bbdb entry as well _if_ it was created at the same day.
