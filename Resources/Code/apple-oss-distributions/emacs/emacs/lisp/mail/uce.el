;;; Commentary:

;; Code in this file provides semi-automatic means of replying to
;; UCE's you might get.  It works currently only with Rmail and Gnus.
;; If you would like to make it work with other mail readers,
;; Rmail-specific section is marked below.  If you want to play with
;; code, please let me know about your changes so I can incorporate
;; them.  I'd appreciate it.

;; Function uce-reply-to-uce, if called when current message in RMAIL
;; buffer is a UCE, will setup *mail* buffer in the following way: it
;; scans full headers of message for 1) normal return address of
;; sender (From, Reply-To lines); and puts these addresses into To:
;; header, it also puts abuse@offenders.host address there 2) mailhub
;; that first saw this message; and puts address of its postmaster
;; into To: header 3) finally, it looks at Message-Id and adds
;; posmaster of that host to the list of addresses.

;; Then, we add "Errors-To: nobody@localhost" header, so that if some
;; of these addresses are not actually correct, we will never see
;; bounced mail.  Also, mail-self-blind and mail-archive-file-name
;; take no effect: the ideology is that we don't want to save junk or
;; replies to junk.

;; Then we put template into buffer (customizable message that
;; explains what has happened), customizable signature, and the
;; original message with full headers and envelope for postmasters.
;; Then buffer is left for editing.

;; The reason that function uce-reply-to-uce is Rmail dependant is
;; that we want full headers of the original message, nothing
;; stripped.  If we use normal means of inserting of the original
;; message into *mail* buffer headers like Received: (not really
;; headers, but envelope lines) will be stripped while they bear
;; valuable for us and postmasters information.  I do wish that there
;; would be some way to write this function in some portable way, but
;; I am not aware of any.

;;; Change log:

;; Dec 10, 1996 -- posted draft version to gnu.sources.emacs

;; Dec 11, 1996 -- fixed some typos, and Francesco Potorti`
;; <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it> pointed out that my use of defvar was
;; weird, suggested fix, and added let form.

;; Dec 17, 1996 -- made scanning for host names little bit more clever
;; (obviously bogus stuff like localhost is now ignored).

;; Nov 11, 1997 -- incorporated changes from Mikael Djurfeldt
;; <mdj@nada.kth.se> to make uce.el work with Gnus.  Changed the text
;; of message that is sent.

;; Dec 3, 1997 -- changes from Gareth Jones <gdj1@gdjones.demon.co.uk>
;; handling Received headers following some line like `From:'.

;; Aug 16, 2000 -- changes from Detlev Zundel
;; <detlev.zundel@stud.uni-karlsruhe.de> to make uce.el work with the
;; latest Gnus.  Lars told him it should work for all versions of Gnus
;; younger than three years.

;; Setup:

;; Add the following line to your ~/.emacs:

;; (autoload 'uce-reply-to-uce "uce" "Reply to UCEs" t nil)

;; If you want to use it with Gnus also use

;; (setq uce-mail-reader 'gnus)

;; store this file (uce.el) somewhere in load-path and byte-compile it.

;;; Variables:

;; uce-message-text is template that will be inserted into buffer.  It
;; has reasonable default.  If you want to write some scarier one,
;; please do so and send it to me.  Please keep it polite.

;; uce-signature behaves just like mail-signature.  If nil, nothing is
;; inserted, if t, file ~/.signature is used, if a string, its
;; contents are inserted into buffer.

;; uce-uce-separator is line that separates your message from the UCE
;; that you enclose.

;; uce-subject-line will be used as subject of outgoing message.  If
;; nil, left blank.

;;; Code:

(defvar gnus-original-article-buffer)
(defvar mail-reply-buffer)
(defvar rmail-current-message)

(require 'sendmail)
;; Those sections of code which are dependent upon
;; RMAIL are only evaluated if we have received a message with RMAIL...

  "Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to,
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you."
