;;; Commentary:

;; This file ensures that, when the point is in a To:, CC:, BCC:, or From:
;; field, word-abbrevs are defined for each of your mail aliases.  These
;; aliases will be defined from your .mailrc file (or the file specified by
;; `mail-personal-alias-file') if it exists.  Your mail aliases will
;; expand any time you type a word-delimiter at the end of an abbreviation.
;;
;; What you see is what you get: if mailabbrev is in use when you type
;; a name, and the name does not expand, you know it is not an abbreviation.
;; However, if you yank abbreviations into the headers
;; in a way that bypasses the check for abbreviations,
;; they are expanded (but not visibly) when you send the message.
;;
;; Your mail alias abbrevs will be in effect only when the point is in an
;; appropriate header field.  When in the body of the message, or other
;; header fields, the mail aliases will not expand.  Rather, the normal
;; mode-specific abbrev table will be used if
;; defined.  So if you use mail-mode specific abbrevs, this code will not
;; adversely affect you.  You can control which header fields the abbrevs
;; are used in by changing the variable mail-abbrev-mode-regexp.
;;
;; If auto-fill mode is on, abbrevs will wrap at commas instead of at word
;; boundaries; also, header continuation-lines will be properly indented.
;;
;; You can also insert a mail alias with mail-abbrev-insert-alias
;; (bound to C-c C-a), which prompts you for an alias (with completion)
;; and inserts its expansion at point.
;;
;; This file fixes a bug in the old system which prohibited your .mailrc
;; file from having lines like
;;
;;     alias someone "John Doe <doe@quux.com>"
;;
;; That is, if you want an address to have embedded spaces, simply surround it
;; with double-quotes.  This is necessary because the format of the .mailrc
;; file bogusly uses spaces as address delimiters.  The following line defines
;; an alias which expands to three addresses:
;;
;;     alias foobar addr-1 addr-2 "address three <addr-3>"
;;
;; (This is bogus because mail-delivery programs want commas, not spaces,
;; but that's what the file format is, so we have to live with it.)
;;
;; If you like, you can call the function define-mail-abbrev to define your
;; mail aliases instead of using a .mailrc file.  When you call it in this
;; way, addresses are separated by commas.
;;
;; CAVEAT: This works on most Sun systems; I have been told that some versions
;; of /bin/mail do not understand double-quotes in the .mailrc file.  So you
;; should make sure your version does before including verbose addresses like
;; this.  One solution to this, if you are on a system whose /bin/mail doesn't
;; work that way, (and you still want to be able to /bin/mail to send mail in
;; addition to emacs) is to define minimal aliases (without full names) in
;; your .mailrc file, and use define-mail-abbrev to redefine them when sending
;; mail from emacs; this way, mail sent from /bin/mail will work, and mail
;; sent from emacs will be pretty.
;;
;; Aliases in the mailrc file may be nested.  If you define aliases like
;;     alias group1 fred ethel
;;     alias group2 larry curly moe
;;     alias everybody group1 group2
;; Then when you type "everybody" on the To: line, it will be expanded to
;;     fred, ethyl, larry, curly, moe
;;
;; Aliases may also contain forward references; the alias of "everybody" can
;; precede the aliases of "group1" and "group2".
;;
;; This code also understands the "source" .mailrc command, for reading
;; aliases from some other file as well.
;;
;; Aliases may contain hyphens, as in "alias foo-bar foo@bar"; word-abbrevs
;; normally cannot contain hyphens, but this code works around that for the
;; specific case of mail-alias word-abbrevs.
;;
;; To read in the contents of another .mailrc-type file from emacs, use the
;; command Meta-X merge-mail-abbrevs.  The rebuild-mail-abbrevs command is
;; similar, but will delete existing aliases first.
;;
;; If you would like your aliases to be expanded when you type M-> or ^N to
;; move out of the mail-header into the message body (instead of having to
;; type SPC at the end of the abbrev before moving away) then you can do
;;
;;  (add-hook
;;   'mail-mode-hook
;;   (lambda ()
;;      (define-key mail-mode-map [remap next-line] 'mail-abbrev-next-line)
;;      (define-key mail-mode-map [remap end-of-buffer] 'mail-abbrev-end-of-buffer)))
;;
;; If you want multiple addresses separated by a string other than ", " then
;; you can set the variable mail-alias-separator-string to it.  This has to
;; be a comma bracketed by whitespace if you want any kind of reasonable
;; behaviour.
;;
;; Thanks to Harald Hanche-Olsen, Michael Ernst, David Loeffler, and
;; Noah Friedman for suggestions and bug reports.

If there is no character in the target line exactly under the current column,

column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.
If there is no line in the buffer after this one,
a newline character is inserted to create a line
and the cursor moves to that line.

The command \\[set-goal-column] can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column to which this command always moves.
Then it does not try to move vertically.  This goal column is stored
in `goal-column', which is nil when there is none.

If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider
using `forward-line' instead.  It is usually easier to use
and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.)."
