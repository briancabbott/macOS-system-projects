;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains macro-expansions functions that are not defined in
;; the Lisp core, namely `macroexpand-all', which expands all macros in
;; a form, not just a top-level one.

;;; Code:

;; Bound by the top-level `macroexpand-all', and modified to include any
;; macros defined by `defmacro'.
