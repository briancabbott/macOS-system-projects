;;; Commentary:

;; This is another implementation of sexp-form regular expressions.
;; It was unfortunately written without being aware of the Sregex
;; package coming with Emacs, but as things stand, Rx completely
;; covers all regexp features, which Sregex doesn't, doesn't suffer
;; from the bugs mentioned in the commentary section of Sregex, and
;; uses a nicer syntax (IMHO, of course :-).

;; This significantly extended version of the original, is almost
;; compatible with Sregex.  The only incompatibility I (fx) know of is
;; that the `repeat' form can't have multiple regexp args.

;; Now alternative forms are provided for a degree of compatibility
;; with Shivers' attempted definitive SRE notation
;; <URL:http://www.ai.mit.edu/~/shivers/sre.txt>.  SRE forms not
;; catered for include: dsm, uncase, w/case, w/nocase, ,@<exp>,
;; ,<exp>, (word ...), word+, posix-string, and character class forms.
;; Some forms are inconsistent with SRE, either for historical reasons
;; or because of the implementation -- simple translation into Emacs
;; regexp strings.  These include: any, word.  Also, case-sensitivity
;; and greediness are controlled by variables external to the regexp,
;; and you need to feed the forms to the `posix-' functions to get
;; SRE's POSIX semantics.  There are probably more difficulties.

;; Rx translates a sexp notation for regular expressions into the
;; usual string notation.  The translation can be done at compile-time
;; by using the `rx' macro.  It can be done at run-time by calling
;; function `rx-to-string'.  See the documentation of `rx' for a
;; complete description of the sexp notation.
;;
;; Some examples of string regexps and their sexp counterparts:
;;
;; "^[a-z]*"
;; (rx (and line-start (0+ (in "a-z"))))
;;
;; "\n[^ \t]"
;; (rx (and "\n" (not blank))), or
;; (rx (and "\n" (not (any " \t"))))
;;
;; "\\*\\*\\* EOOH \\*\\*\\*\n"
;; (rx "*** EOOH ***\n")
;;
;; "\\<\\(catch\\|finally\\)\\>[^_]"
;; (rx (and word-start (submatch (or "catch" "finally")) word-end
;;          (not (any ?_))))
;;
;; "[ \t\n]*:\\([^:]+\\|$\\)"
;; (rx (and (zero-or-more (in " \t\n")) ":"
;;          (submatch (or line-end (one-or-more (not (any ?:)))))))
;;
;; "^content-transfer-encoding:\\(\n?[\t ]\\)*quoted-printable\\(\n?[\t ]\\)*"
;; (rx (and line-start
;;          "content-transfer-encoding:"
;;          (+ (? ?\n)) blank
;;	    "quoted-printable"
;;	    (+ (? ?\n)) blank))
;;
;; (concat "^\\(?:" something-else "\\)")
;; (rx (and line-start (eval something-else))), statically or
;; (rx-to-string '(and line-start ,something-else)), dynamically.
;;
;; (regexp-opt '(STRING1 STRING2 ...))
;; (rx (or STRING1 STRING2 ...)), or in other words, `or' automatically
;; calls `regexp-opt' as needed.
;;
;; "^;;\\s-*\n\\|^\n"
;; (rx (or (and line-start ";;" (0+ space) ?\n)
;;         (and line-start ?\n)))
;;
;; "\\$[I]d: [^ ]+ \\([^ ]+\\) "
;; (rx (and "$Id: "
;;          (1+ (not (in " ")))
;;          " "
;;          (submatch (1+ (not (in " "))))
;;          " "))

\"[ab]c\", and \"ab\\|ab*c\" are not atomic.

This function may return false negatives, but it will not
return false positives.  It is nevertheless useful in
situations where an efficiency shortcut can be taken iff a
regexp is atomic.  The function can be improved to detect
more cases of atomic regexps.  Presently, this function
detects the following categories of atomic regexp;

  a group or shy group:  \\(...\\)
  a character class:     [...]
  a single character:    a

On the other hand, false negatives will be returned for
regexps that are atomic but end in operators, such as
\"a+\".  I think these are rare.  Probably such cases could
be detected without much effort.  A guarantee of no false
negatives would require a theoretic specification of the set
of all atomic regexps."

REGEXPS is a non-empty sequence of forms of the sort listed below.

     `control', `hex-digit', `blank', `graph', `print', `alnum',
     `alpha', `ascii', `nonascii', `lower', `punct', `space', `upper',
     `word', or one of their synonyms.

`(not (any SET ...))'

`(not (category CATEGORY))'
     matches a character that doesn't have category CATEGORY.

`(and SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(: SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(seq SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(sequence SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches what SEXP1 matches, followed by what SEXP2 matches, etc.

`(submatch SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(group SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     like `and', but makes the match accessible with `match-end',
     `match-beginning', and `match-string'.

`(group SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     another name for `submatch'.

`(or SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
`(| SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches anything that matches SEXP1 or SEXP2, etc.  If all
     args are strings, use `regexp-opt' to optimize the resulting
     regular expression.

`(minimal-match SEXP)'
     produce a non-greedy regexp for SEXP.  Normally, regexps matching
     zero or more occurrences of something are \"greedy\" in that they
     match as much as they can, as long as the overall regexp can
     still match.  A non-greedy regexp matches as little as possible.

`(maximal-match SEXP)'
     produce a greedy regexp for SEXP.  This is the default.

Below, `SEXP ...' represents a sequence of regexp forms, treated as if
enclosed in `(and ...)'.

`(zero-or-more SEXP ...)'
`(0+ SEXP ...)'
     matches zero or more occurrences of what SEXP ... matches.

`(* SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp, independent
     of `rx-greedy-flag'.

`(*? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp,
     independent of `rx-greedy-flag'.

`(one-or-more SEXP ...)'
`(1+ SEXP ...)'
     matches one or more occurrences of SEXP ...

`(+ SEXP ...)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(+? SEXP ...)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(zero-or-one SEXP ...)'
`(optional SEXP ...)'
`(opt SEXP ...)'
     matches zero or one occurrences of A.

`(? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(?? SEXP ...)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(repeat N SEXP)'
`(= N SEXP ...)'
     matches N occurrences.

`(>= N SEXP ...)'
     matches N or more occurrences.

`(repeat N M SEXP)'
`(** N M SEXP ...)'
     matches N to M occurrences.

`(backref N)'
    matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(backref N)'
     matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(backref N)'
    matches what was matched previously by submatch N.

`(eval FORM)'
     evaluate FORM and insert result.  If result is a string,
     `regexp-quote' it.

`(regexp REGEXP)'
     include REGEXP in string notation in the result."
