;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:

;; Provide a meaningful error message if we are running on
;; bare (non-float) emacs.

(if (fboundp 'atan)
    nil
  (error "Floating point was disabled at compile time"))

;; provide an easy hook to tell if we are running with floats or not.
;; define pi and e via math-lib calls. (much less prone to killer typos.)
(defconst pi (* 4 (atan 1)) "The value of Pi (3.1415926...).")

;; It's too inconvenient to make `e' a constant because it's used as
;; a temporary variable all the time.
(defvar e (exp 1) "The value of e (2.7182818...).")

(defconst degrees-to-radians (/ pi 180.0)
  "Degrees to radian conversion constant.")
(defconst radians-to-degrees (/ 180.0 pi)
  "Radian to degree conversion constant.")

;; these expand to a single multiply by a float when byte compiled

(defmacro degrees-to-radians (x)
  "Convert ARG from degrees to radians."
  (list '* (/ pi 180.0) x))
(defmacro radians-to-degrees (x)
  "Convert ARG from radians to degrees."
  (list '* (/ 180.0 pi) x))
