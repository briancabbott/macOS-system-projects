;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the operations on rectangles that are documented
;; in the Emacs manual.

;; ### NOTE: this file has been almost completely rewritten by Didier Verna
;; <didier@xemacs.org> in July 1999. The purpose of this rewrite is to be less
;; intrusive and fill lines with whitespaces only when needed. A few functions
;; are untouched though, as noted above their definition.


;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun move-to-column-force (column &optional flag)
  "If COLUMN is within a multi-column character, replace it by spaces and tab.
As for `move-to-column', passing anything but nil or t in FLAG will move to
the desired column only if the line is long enough."
  (move-to-column column (or flag t)))

;; not used any more --dv
;; extract-rectangle-line stores lines into this list
;; to accumulate them for extract-rectangle and delete-extract-rectangle.

;; ### NOTE: this function is untouched, but not used anymore apart from
;; `delete-whitespace-rectangle'. `apply-on-rectangle' is used instead. --dv
