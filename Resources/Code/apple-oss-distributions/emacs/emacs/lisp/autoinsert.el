;;; Commentary:

;;  The following defines an association list for text to be
;;  automatically inserted when a new file is created, and a function
;;  which automatically inserts these files; the idea is to insert
;;  default text much as the mode is automatically set using
;;  auto-mode-alist.
;;
;;  To use:
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'auto-insert)
;;     setq auto-insert-directory to an appropriate slash-terminated value
;;
;;  You can also customize the variable `auto-insert-mode' to load the
;;  package.  Alternatively, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;  (auto-insert-mode 1)

CONDITION may be a regexp that must match the new file's name, or it may be
