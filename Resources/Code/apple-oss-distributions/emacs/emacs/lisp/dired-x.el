;;; Commentary:

;; This is Sebastian Kremer's excellent dired-x.el (Dired Extra), version
;; 1.191, hacked up for GNU Emacs.  Redundant or conflicting material has
;; been removed or renamed in order to work properly with dired of GNU
;; Emacs.  All suggestions or comments are most welcomed.

;; Please, PLEASE, *PLEASE* see the info pages.

;; BUGS: Type M-x dired-x-submit-report and a report will be generated.

;;;   `dired-do-find-marked-files''s prefix argument NOSELECT.
;;;
;;; * `dired-simultaneous-find-file' runs through FILE-LIST decrementing the
;;;   list each time.
;;;
;;; * If NOSELECT is non-nil then just run `find-file-noselect'  on each
;;;   element of FILE-LIST.
;;;
;;; * If NOSELECT is nil then calculate the `size' of the window for each file
;;;   by dividing the `window-height' by length of FILE-LIST.  Thus, `size' is
;;;   cognizant of the window-configuration.
;;;
;;; * If `size' is too small abort, otherwise run `find-file' on each element
;;;   of FILE-LIST giving each a window of height `size'.
