;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is fully documented in the Emacs user's manual.
;;
;; Supported version-control systems presently include CVS, RCS, GNU Arch,
;; Subversion, Meta-CVS, and SCCS (or its free replacement, CSSC).
;;
;; Some features will not work with old RCS versions.  Where
;; appropriate, VC finds out which version you have, and allows or
;; disallows those features (stealing locks, for example, works only
;; from 5.6.2 onwards).
;; Even initial checkins will fail if your RCS version is so old that ci
;; doesn't understand -t-; this has been known to happen to people running
;; NExTSTEP 3.0.
;;
;; You can support the RCS -x option by customizing vc-rcs-master-templates.
;;
;; Proper function of the SCCS diff commands requires the shellscript vcdiff
;; to be installed somewhere on Emacs's path for executables.
;;
;; If your site uses the ChangeLog convention supported by Emacs, the
;; function log-edit-comment-to-change-log could prove a useful checkin hook,
;; although you might prefer to use C-c C-a (i.e. log-edit-insert-changelog)
;; from the commit buffer instead or to set `log-edit-setup-invert'.
;;
;; The vc code maintains some internal state in order to reduce expensive
;; version-control operations to a minimum.  Some names are only computed
;; once.  If you perform version control operations with the backend while
;; vc's back is turned, or move/rename master files while vc is running,
;; vc may get seriously confused.  Don't do these things!
;;
;; Developer's notes on some concurrency issues are included at the end of
;; the file.
;;
;; ADDING SUPPORT FOR OTHER BACKENDS
;;
;; VC can use arbitrary version control systems as a backend.  To add
;; support for a new backend named SYS, write a library vc-sys.el that
;; contains functions of the form `vc-sys-...' (note that SYS is in lower
;; case for the function and library names).  VC will use that library if
;; you put the symbol SYS somewhere into the list of
;; `vc-handled-backends'.  Then, for example, if `vc-sys-registered'
;; returns non-nil for a file, all SYS-specific versions of VC commands
;; will be available for that file.
;;
;; VC keeps some per-file information in the form of properties (see
;; vc-file-set/getprop in vc-hooks.el).  The backend-specific functions
;; do not generally need to be aware of these properties.  For example,
;; `vc-sys-workfile-version' should compute the workfile version and
;; return it; it should not look it up in the property, and it needn't
;; store it there either.  However, if a backend-specific function does
;; store a value in a property, that value takes precedence over any
;; value that the generic code might want to set (check for uses of
;; the macro `with-vc-properties' in vc.el).
;;
;; In the list of functions below, each identifier needs to be prepended
;; with `vc-sys-'.  Some of the functions are mandatory (marked with a
;; `*'), others are optional (`-').
;;
;; STATE-QUERYING FUNCTIONS
;;
;; * registered (file)
;;
;;   Return non-nil if FILE is registered in this backend.
;;
;; * state (file)
;;
;;   Return the current version control state of FILE.  For a list of
;;   possible values, see `vc-state'.  This function should do a full and
;;   reliable state computation; it is usually called immediately after
;;   C-x v v.  If you want to use a faster heuristic when visiting a
;;   file, put that into `state-heuristic' below.
;;
;; - state-heuristic (file)
;;
;;   If provided, this function is used to estimate the version control
;;   state of FILE at visiting time.  It should be considerably faster
;;   than the implementation of `state'.  For a list of possible values,
;;   see the doc string of `vc-state'.
;;
;; - dir-state (dir)
;;
;;   If provided, this function is used to find the version control state
;;   of all files in DIR in a fast way.  The function should not return
;;   anything, but rather store the files' states into the corresponding
;;   `vc-state' properties.
;;
;; * workfile-version (file)
;;
;;   Return the current workfile version of FILE.
;;
;; - latest-on-branch-p (file)
;;
;;   Return non-nil if the current workfile version of FILE is the latest
;;   on its branch.  The default implementation always returns t, which
;;   means that working with non-current versions is not supported by
;;   default.
;;
;; * checkout-model (file)
;;
;;   Indicate whether FILE needs to be "checked out" before it can be
;;   edited.  See `vc-checkout-model' for a list of possible values.
;;
;; - workfile-unchanged-p (file)
;;
;;   Return non-nil if FILE is unchanged from its current workfile
;;   version.  This function should do a brief comparison of FILE's
;;   contents with those of the master version.  If the backend does not
;;   have such a brief-comparison feature, the default implementation of
;;   this function can be used, which delegates to a full
;;   vc-BACKEND-diff.  (Note that vc-BACKEND-diff must not run
;;   asynchronously in this case, see variable `vc-disable-async-diff'.)
;;
;; - mode-line-string (file)
;;
;;   If provided, this function should return the VC-specific mode line
;;   string for FILE.  The default implementation deals well with all
;;   states that `vc-state' can return.
;;
;; - dired-state-info (file)
;;
;;   Translate the `vc-state' property of FILE into a string that can be
;;   used in a vc-dired buffer.  The default implementation deals well
;;   with all states that `vc-state' can return.
;;
;; STATE-CHANGING FUNCTIONS
;;
;; * register (file &optional rev comment)
;;
;;   Register FILE in this backend.  Optionally, an initial revision REV
;;   and an initial description of the file, COMMENT, may be specified.
;;   The implementation should pass the value of vc-register-switches
;;   to the backend command.
;;
;; - init-version (file)
;;
;;   The initial version to use when registering FILE if one is not
;;   specified by the user.  If not provided, the variable
;;   vc-default-init-version is used instead.
;;
;; - responsible-p (file)
;;
;;   Return non-nil if this backend considers itself "responsible" for
;;   FILE, which can also be a directory.  This function is used to find
;;   out what backend to use for registration of new files and for things
;;   like change log generation.  The default implementation always
;;   returns nil.
;;
;; - could-register (file)
;;
;;   Return non-nil if FILE could be registered under this backend.  The
;;   default implementation always returns t.
;;
;; - receive-file (file rev)
;;
;;   Let this backend "receive" a file that is already registered under
;;   another backend.  The default implementation simply calls `register'
;;   for FILE, but it can be overridden to do something more specific,
;;   e.g. keep revision numbers consistent or choose editing modes for
;;   FILE that resemble those of the other backend.
;;
;; - unregister (file)
;;
;;   Unregister FILE from this backend.  This is only needed if this
;;   backend may be used as a "more local" backend for temporary editing.
;;
;; * checkin (file rev comment)
;;
;;   Commit changes in FILE to this backend.  If REV is non-nil, that
;;   should become the new revision number.  COMMENT is used as a
;;   check-in comment.  The implementation should pass the value of
;;   vc-checkin-switches to the backend command.
;;
;; * find-version (file rev buffer)
;;
;;   Fetch revision REV of file FILE and put it into BUFFER.
;;   If REV is the empty string, fetch the head of the trunk.
;;   The implementation should pass the value of vc-checkout-switches
;;   to the backend command.
;;
;; * checkout (file &optional editable rev)
;;
;;   Check out revision REV of FILE into the working area.  If EDITABLE
;;   is non-nil, FILE should be writable by the user and if locking is
;;   used for FILE, a lock should also be set.  If REV is non-nil, that
;;   is the revision to check out (default is current workfile version).
;;   If REV is t, that means to check out the head of the current branch;
;;   if it is the empty string, check out the head of the trunk.
;;   The implementation should pass the value of vc-checkout-switches
;;   to the backend command.
;;
;; * revert (file &optional contents-done)
;;
;;   Revert FILE back to the current workfile version.  If optional
;;   arg CONTENTS-DONE is non-nil, then the contents of FILE have
;;   already been reverted from a version backup, and this function
;;   only needs to update the status of FILE within the backend.
;;
;; - cancel-version (file editable)
;;
;;   Cancel the current workfile version of FILE, i.e. remove it from the
;;   master.  EDITABLE non-nil means that FILE should be writable
;;   afterwards, and if locking is used for FILE, then a lock should also
;;   be set.  If this function is not provided, trying to cancel a
;;   version is caught as an error.
;;
;; - merge (file rev1 rev2)
;;
;;   Merge the changes between REV1 and REV2 into the current working file.
;;
;; - merge-news (file)
;;
;;   Merge recent changes from the current branch into FILE.
;;
;; - steal-lock (file &optional version)
;;
;;   Steal any lock on the current workfile version of FILE, or on
;;   VERSION if that is provided.  This function is only needed if
;;   locking is used for files under this backend, and if files can
;;   indeed be locked by other users.
;;
;; HISTORY FUNCTIONS
;;
;; * print-log (file &optional buffer)
;;
;;   Insert the revision log of FILE into BUFFER, or the *vc* buffer
;;   if BUFFER is nil.
;;
;; - show-log-entry (version)
;;
;;   If provided, search the log entry for VERSION in the current buffer,
;;   and make sure it is displayed in the buffer's window.  The default
;;   implementation of this function works for RCS-style logs.
;;
;; - wash-log (file)
;;
;;   Remove all non-comment information from the output of print-log.  The
;;   default implementation of this function works for RCS-style logs.
;;
;; - logentry-check ()
;;
;;   If defined, this function is run to find out whether the user
;;   entered a valid log entry for check-in.  The log entry is in the
;;   current buffer, and if it is not a valid one, the function should
;;   throw an error.
;;
;; - comment-history (file)
;;
;;   Return a string containing all log entries that were made for FILE.
;;   This is used for transferring a file from one backend to another,
;;   retaining comment information.  The default implementation of this
;;   function does this by calling print-log and then wash-log, and
;;   returning the resulting buffer contents as a string.
;;
;; - update-changelog (files)
;;
;;   Using recent log entries, create ChangeLog entries for FILES, or for
;;   all files at or below the default-directory if FILES is nil.  The
;;   default implementation runs rcs2log, which handles RCS- and
;;   CVS-style logs.
;;
;; * diff (file &optional rev1 rev2 buffer)
;;
;;   Insert the diff for FILE into BUFFER, or the *vc-diff* buffer if
;;   BUFFER is nil.  If REV1 and REV2 are non-nil, report differences
;;   from REV1 to REV2.  If REV1 is nil, use the current workfile
;;   version (as found in the repository) as the older version; if
;;   REV2 is nil, use the current workfile contents as the newer
;;   version.  This function should pass the value of (vc-switches
;;   BACKEND 'diff) to the backend command.  It should return a status
;;   of either 0 (no differences found), or 1 (either non-empty diff
;;   or the diff is run asynchronously).
;;
;; - diff-tree (dir &optional rev1 rev2)
;;
;;   Insert the diff for all files at and below DIR into the *vc-diff*
;;   buffer.  The meaning of REV1 and REV2 is the same as for
;;   vc-BACKEND-diff.  The default implementation does an explicit tree
;;   walk, calling vc-BACKEND-diff for each individual file.
;;
;; - annotate-command (file buf &optional rev)
;;
;;   If this function is provided, it should produce an annotated display
;;   of FILE in BUF, relative to version REV.  Annotation means each line
;;   of FILE displayed is prefixed with version information associated with
;;   its addition (deleted lines leave no history) and that the text of the
;;   file is fontified according to age.
;;
;; - annotate-time ()
;;
;;   Only required if `annotate-command' is defined for the backend.
;;   Return the time of the next line of annotation at or after point,
;;   as a floating point fractional number of days.  The helper
;;   function `vc-annotate-convert-time' may be useful for converting
;;   multi-part times as returned by `current-time' and `encode-time'
;;   to this format.  Return nil if no more lines of annotation appear
;;   in the buffer.  You can safely assume that point is placed at the
;;   beginning of each line, starting at `point-min'.  The buffer that
;;   point is placed in is the Annotate output, as defined by the
;;   relevant backend.  This function also affects how much of the line
;;   is fontified; where it leaves point is where fontification begins.
;;
;; - annotate-current-time ()
;;
;;   Only required if `annotate-command' is defined for the backend,
;;   AND you'd like the current time considered to be anything besides
;;   (vs-annotate-convert-time (current-time)) -- i.e. the current
;;   time with hours, minutes, and seconds included.  Probably safe to
;;   ignore.  Return the current-time, in units of fractional days.
;;
;; - annotate-extract-revision-at-line ()
;;
;;   Only required if `annotate-command' is defined for the backend.
;;   Invoked from a buffer in vc-annotate-mode, return the revision
;;   corresponding to the current line, or nil if there is no revision
;;   corresponding to the current line.
;;
;; SNAPSHOT SYSTEM
;;
;; - create-snapshot (dir name branchp)
;;
;;   Take a snapshot of the current state of files under DIR and name it
;;   NAME.  This should make sure that files are up-to-date before
;;   proceeding with the action.  DIR can also be a file and if BRANCHP
;;   is specified, NAME should be created as a branch and DIR should be
;;   checked out under this new branch.  The default implementation does
;;   not support branches but does a sanity check, a tree traversal and
;;   for each file calls `assign-name'.
;;
;; - assign-name (file name)
;;
;;   Give name NAME to the current version of FILE, assuming it is
;;   up-to-date.  Only used by the default version of `create-snapshot'.
;;
;; - retrieve-snapshot (dir name update)
;;
;;   Retrieve a named snapshot of all registered files at or below DIR.
;;   If UPDATE is non-nil, then update buffers of any files in the
;;   snapshot that are currently visited.  The default implementation
;;   does a sanity check whether there aren't any uncommitted changes at
;;   or below DIR, and then performs a tree walk, using the `checkout'
;;   function to retrieve the corresponding versions.
;;
;; MISCELLANEOUS
;;
;; - make-version-backups-p (file)
;;
;;   Return non-nil if unmodified repository versions of FILE should be
;;   backed up locally.  If this is done, VC can perform `diff' and
;;   `revert' operations itself, without calling the backend system.  The
;;   default implementation always returns nil.
;;
;; - repository-hostname (dirname)
;;
;;   Return the hostname that the backend will have to contact
;;   in order to operate on a file in DIRNAME.  If the return value
;;   is nil, it means that the repository is local.
;;   This function is used in `vc-stay-local-p' which backends can use
;;   for their convenience.
;;
;; - previous-version (file rev)
;;
;;   Return the version number that precedes REV for FILE, or nil if no such
;;   version exists.
;;
;; - next-version (file rev)
;;
;;   Return the version number that follows REV for FILE, or nil if no such
;;   version exists.
;;
;; - check-headers ()
;;
;;   Return non-nil if the current buffer contains any version headers.
;;
;; - clear-headers ()
;;
;;   In the current buffer, reset all version headers to their unexpanded
;;   form.  This function should be provided if the state-querying code
;;   for this backend uses the version headers to determine the state of
;;   a file.  This function will then be called whenever VC changes the
;;   version control state in such a way that the headers would give
;;   wrong information.
;;
;; - delete-file (file)
;;
;;   Delete FILE and mark it as deleted in the repository.  If this
;;   function is not provided, the command `vc-delete-file' will
;;   signal an error.
;;
;; - rename-file (old new)
;;
;;   Rename file OLD to NEW, both in the working area and in the
;;   repository.  If this function is not provided, the renaming
;;   will be done by (vc-delete-file old) and (vc-register new).
;;
;; - find-file-hook ()
;;
;;   Operation called in current buffer when opening a file.  This can
;;   be used by the backend to setup some local variables it might need.
;
;; - find-file-not-found-hook ()
;;
;;   Operation called in current buffer when opening a non-existing file.
;;   By default, this asks the user if she wants to check out the file.

If you call this from within a VC dired buffer with no files marked,
it will operate on the file in the current line.

If you call this from within a VC dired buffer, and one or more
files are marked, it will accept a log message and then operate on
each one.  The log message will be used as a comment for any register
or checkin operations, but ignored when doing checkouts.  Attempted
lock steals will raise an error.

A prefix argument lets you specify the version number to use.

For RCS and SCCS files:
   If the file is not already registered, this registers it for version
control.
   If the file is registered and not locked by anyone, this checks out
a writable and locked file ready for editing.
   If the file is checked out and locked by the calling user, this
first checks to see if the file has changed since checkout.  If not,
it performs a revert.
   If the file has been changed, this pops up a buffer for entry
of a log message; when the message has been entered, it checks in the
resulting changes along with the log message as change commentary.  If
the variable `vc-keep-workfiles' is non-nil (which is its default), a
read-only copy of the changed file is left in place afterwards.
   If the file is registered and locked by someone else, you are given
the option to steal the lock.

For CVS files:
   If the file is not already registered, this registers it for version
control.  This does a \"cvs add\", but no \"cvs commit\".
   If the file is added but not committed, it is committed.
   If your working file is changed, but the repository file is
unchanged, this pops up a buffer for entry of a log message; when the
message has been entered, it checks in the resulting changes along
with the logmessage as change commentary.  A writable file is retained.
   If the repository file is changed, you are asked if you want to
merge in the changes into your working copy."

This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current
file, when it was last edited and by whom.  Additionally, colors are
used to show the age of each line--blue means oldest, red means
youngest, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a version number; then the buffer
displays and annotates that version instead of the current version
\(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,
you are prompted for the time span in days which the color range
should cover.  For example, a time span of 20 days means that changes
over the past 20 days are shown in red to blue, according to their
age, and everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

`vc-annotate-menu-elements' customizes the menu elements of the

;; DEVELOPER'S NOTES ON CONCURRENCY PROBLEMS IN THIS CODE
;;
;; These may be useful to anyone who has to debug or extend the package.
;; (Note that this information corresponds to versions 5.x. Some of it
;; might have been invalidated by the additions to support branching
;; and RCS keyword lookup. AS, 1995/03/24)
;;
;; A fundamental problem in VC is that there are time windows between
;; vc-next-action's computations of the file's version-control state and
;; the actions that change it.  This is a window open to lossage in a
;; multi-user environment; someone else could nip in and change the state
;; of the master during it.
;;
;; The performance problem is that rlog/prs calls are very expensive; we want
;; to avoid them as much as possible.
;;
;; ANALYSIS:
;;
;; The performance problem, it turns out, simplifies in practice to the
;; problem of making vc-state fast.  The two other functions that call
;; prs/rlog will not be so commonly used that the slowdown is a problem; one
;; makes snapshots, the other deletes the calling user's last change in the
;; master.
;;
;; The race condition implies that we have to either (a) lock the master
;; during the entire execution of vc-next-action, or (b) detect and
;; recover from errors resulting from dispatch on an out-of-date state.
;;
;; Alternative (a) appears to be infeasible.  The problem is that we can't
;; guarantee that the lock will ever be removed.  Suppose a user starts a
;; checkin, the change message buffer pops up, and the user, having wandered
;; off to do something else, simply forgets about it?
;;
;; Alternative (b), on the other hand, works well with a cheap way to speed up
;; vc-state.  Usually, if a file is registered, we can read its locked/
;; unlocked state and its current owner from its permissions.
;;
;; This shortcut will fail if someone has manually changed the workfile's
;; permissions; also if developers are munging the workfile in several
;; directories, with symlinks to a master (in this latter case, the
;; permissions shortcut will fail to detect a lock asserted from another
;; directory).
;;
;; Note that these cases correspond exactly to the errors which could happen
;; because of a competing checkin/checkout race in between two instances of
;; vc-next-action.
;;
;; For VC's purposes, a workfile/master pair may have the following states:
;;
;; A. Unregistered.  There is a workfile, there is no master.
;;
;; B. Registered and not locked by anyone.
;;
;; C. Locked by calling user and unchanged.
;;
;; D. Locked by the calling user and changed.
;;
;; E. Locked by someone other than the calling user.
;;
;; This makes for 25 states and 20 error conditions.  Here's the matrix:
;;
;; VC's idea of state
;;  |
;;  V  Actual state   RCS action              SCCS action          Effect
;;    A  B  C  D  E
;;  A .  1  2  3  4   ci -u -t-          admin -fb -i<file>      initial admin
;;  B 5  .  6  7  8   co -l              get -e                  checkout
;;  C 9  10 .  11 12  co -u              unget; get              revert
;;  D 13 14 15 .  16  ci -u -m<comment>  delta -y<comment>; get  checkin
;;  E 17 18 19 20 .   rcs -u -M -l       unget -n ; get -g       steal lock
;;
;; All commands take the master file name as a last argument (not shown).
;;
;; In the discussion below, a "self-race" is a pathological situation in
;; which VC operations are being attempted simultaneously by two or more
;; Emacsen running under the same username.
;;
;; The vc-next-action code has the following windows:
;;
;; Window P:
;;    Between the check for existence of a master file and the call to
;; admin/checkin in vc-buffer-admin (apparent state A).  This window may
;; never close if the initial-comment feature is on.
;;
;; Window Q:
;;    Between the call to vc-workfile-unchanged-p in and the immediately
;; following revert (apparent state C).
;;
;; Window R:
;;    Between the call to vc-workfile-unchanged-p in and the following
;; checkin (apparent state D).  This window may never close.
;;
;; Window S:
;;    Between the unlock and the immediately following checkout during a
;; revert operation (apparent state C).  Included in window Q.
;;
;; Window T:
;;    Between vc-state and the following checkout (apparent state B).
;;
;; Window U:
;;    Between vc-state and the following revert (apparent state C).
;; Includes windows Q and S.
;;
;; Window V:
;;    Between vc-state and the following checkin (apparent state
;; D).  This window may never be closed if the user fails to complete the
;; checkin message.  Includes window R.
;;
;; Window W:
;;    Between vc-state and the following steal-lock (apparent
;; state E).  This window may never close if the user fails to complete
;; the steal-lock message.  Includes window X.
;;
;; Window X:
;;    Between the unlock and the immediately following re-lock during a
;; steal-lock operation (apparent state E).  This window may never close
;; if the user fails to complete the steal-lock message.
;;
;; Errors:
;;
;; Apparent state A ---
;;
;; 1. File looked unregistered but is actually registered and not locked.
;;
;;    Potential cause: someone else's admin during window P, with
;; caller's admin happening before their checkout.
;;
;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, ci fails with message
;;         "no lock set by <user>".  From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new
;;         ci -i option and the message is "<file>,v: already exists".
;;    SCCS: admin will fail with error (ad19).
;;
;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;
;; 2. File looked unregistered but is actually locked by caller, unchanged.
;;
;;    Potential cause: self-race during window P.
;;
;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, reverts the file to the last saved
;;         version and unlocks it.  From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new
;;         ci -i option, failing with message "<file>,v: already exists".
;;    SCCS: will fail with error (ad19).
;;
;;    Either of these consequences is acceptable.
;;
;; 3. File looked unregistered but is actually locked by caller, changed.
;;
;;    Potential cause: self-race during window P.
;;
;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, VC registers the caller's workfile as
;;         a delta with a null change comment (the -t- switch will be
;;         ignored). From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new ci -i option,
;;         failing with message "<file>,v: already exists".
;;    SCCS: will fail with error (ad19).
;;
;; 4. File looked unregistered but is locked by someone else.
;;;
;;    Potential cause: someone else's admin during window P, with
;; caller's admin happening *after* their checkout.
;;
;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, ci fails with a
;;         "no lock set by <user>" message.  From 5.6.4 onwards,
;;         VC uses the new ci -i option, failing with message
;;         "<file>,v: already exists".
;;    SCCS: will fail with error (ad19).
;;
;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;
;; Apparent state B ---
;;
;; 5. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually unregistered.
;;
;;    Potential cause: master file got nuked during window P.
;;
;;    RCS: will fail with "RCS/<file>: No such file or directory"
;;    SCCS: will fail with error ut4.
;;
;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;
;; 6. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually locked by the
;; calling user and unchanged.
;;
;;    Potential cause: self-race during window T.
;;
;;    RCS: in the same directory as the previous workfile, co -l will fail
;; with "co error: writable foo exists; checkout aborted".  In any other
;; directory, checkout will succeed.
;;    SCCS: will fail with ge17.
;;
;;    Either of these consequences is acceptable.
;;
;; 7. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually locked by the
;; calling user and changed.
;;
;;    As case 6.
;;
;; 8. File looked registered and not locked, but is actually locked by another
;; user.
;;
;;    Potential cause: someone else checks it out during window T.
;;
;;    RCS: co error: revision 1.3 already locked by <user>
;;    SCCS: fails with ge4 (in directory) or ut7 (outside it).
;;
;;    We can let these errors be passed up to the user.
;;
;; Apparent state C ---
;;
;; 9. File looks locked by calling user and unchanged, but is unregistered.
;;
;;    As case 5.
;;
;; 10. File looks locked by calling user and unchanged, but is actually not
;; locked.
;;
;;    Potential cause: a self-race in window U, or by the revert's
;; landing during window X of some other user's steal-lock or window S
;; of another user's revert.
;;
;;    RCS: succeeds, refreshing the file from the identical version in
;; the master.
;;    SCCS: fails with error ut4 (p file nonexistent).
;;
;;    Either of these consequences is acceptable.
;;
;; 11. File is locked by calling user.  It looks unchanged, but is actually
;; changed.
;;
;;    Potential cause: the file would have to be touched by a self-race
;; during window Q.
;;
;;    The revert will succeed, removing whatever changes came with
;; the touch.  It is theoretically possible that work could be lost.
;;
;; 12. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and unchanged, but
;; it's actually locked by someone else.
;;
;;    Potential cause: a steal-lock in window V.
;;
;;    RCS: co error: revision <rev> locked by <user>; use co -r or rcs -u
;;    SCCS: fails with error un2
;;
;;    We can pass these errors up to the user.
;;
;; Apparent state D ---
;;
;; 13. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;; actually unregistered.
;;
;;    Potential cause: master file got nuked during window P.
;;
;;    RCS: Prior to version 5.6.4, checks in the user's version as an
;;         initial delta.  From 5.6.4 onwards, VC uses the new ci -j
;;         option, failing with message "no such file or directory".
;;    SCCS: will fail with error ut4.
;;
;;    This case is kind of nasty.  Under RCS prior to version 5.6.4,
;; VC may fail to detect the loss of previous version information.
;;
;; 14. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;; actually unlocked.
;;
;;    Potential cause: self-race in window V, or the checkin happening
;; during the window X of someone else's steal-lock or window S of
;; someone else's revert.
;;
;;    RCS: ci will fail with "no lock set by <user>".
;;    SCCS: delta will fail with error ut4.
;;
;; 15. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;; actually locked by the calling user and unchanged.
;;
;;    Potential cause: another self-race --- a whole checkin/checkout
;; sequence by the calling user would have to land in window R.
;;
;;    SCCS: checks in a redundant delta and leaves the file unlocked as usual.
;;    RCS: reverts to the file state as of the second user's checkin, leaving
;; the file unlocked.
;;
;;    It is theoretically possible that work could be lost under RCS.
;;
;; 16. File looks like it's locked by the calling user and changed, but it's
;; actually locked by a different user.
;;
;;    RCS: ci error: no lock set by <user>
;;    SCCS: unget will fail with error un2
;;
;;    We can pass these errors up to the user.
;;
;; Apparent state E ---
;;
;; 17. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;; unregistered.
;;
;;    As case 13.
;;
;; 18. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;; unlocked.
;;
;;    Potential cause: someone released a lock during window W.
;;
;;    RCS: The calling user will get the lock on the file.
;;    SCCS: unget -n will fail with cm4.
;;
;;    Either of these consequences will be OK.
;;
;; 19. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;; locked by the calling user and unchanged.
;;
;;    Potential cause: the other user relinquishing a lock followed by
;; a self-race, both in window W.
;;
;;     Under both RCS and SCCS, both unlock and lock will succeed, making
;; the sequence a no-op.
;;
;; 20. File looks like it's locked by some other user, but it's actually
;; locked by the calling user and changed.
;;
;;     As case 19.
;;
;; PROBLEM CASES:
;;
;;    In order of decreasing severity:
;;
;;    Cases 11 and 15 are the only ones that potentially lose work.
;; They would require a self-race for this to happen.
;;
;;    Case 13 in RCS loses information about previous deltas, retaining
;; only the information in the current workfile.  This can only happen
;; if the master file gets nuked in window P.
;;

;;    Cases 2, 10, 19 and 20 do extra work, but make no changes.

;;    Thus, there is no explicit recovery code.
