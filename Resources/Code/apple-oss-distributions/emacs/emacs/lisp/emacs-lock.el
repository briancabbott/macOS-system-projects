;;; Commentary:

;; This code sets a buffer-local variable to t if toggle-emacs-lock is run,
;; then if the user attempts to exit Emacs, the locked buffer name will be
;; displayed and the exit aborted.  This is just a way of protecting
;; yourself from yourself.  For example, if you have a shell running a big
;; program and exiting Emacs would abort that program, you may want to lock
;; that buffer, then if you forget about it after a while, you won't
;; accidentally exit Emacs.  To unlock the buffer, just goto the buffer and
;; run toggle-emacs-lock again.

;;; Code:

; These next defuns make it so if you exit a shell that is locked,  the lock
; is shut off for that shell so you can exit Emacs.  Same for telnet.
; Also, if a shell or a telnet buffer was locked and the process killed,
; turn the lock back on again if the process is restarted.
