values: `symbolic-name' (TAG is a string), `revision-number' (TAG is a
string) and `date' (TAG is a date as returned by `encode-time').  The
return value of the function or macro will be displayed as a string.

dates and the word \"Sticky\" for sticky tag names and revisions.

displayed.  Date and time is displayed for sticky dates.
