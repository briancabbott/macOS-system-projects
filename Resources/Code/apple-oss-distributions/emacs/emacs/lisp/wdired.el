;;; Commentary:

;; wdired.el (the "w" is for writable) provides an alternative way of
;; renaming files.
;;
;; Have you ever wished to use C-x r t (string-rectangle), M-%
;; (query-replace), M-c (capitalize-word), etc... to change the name of
;; the files in a "dired" buffer? Now you can do this.  All the power
;; of Emacs commands are available to renaming files!
;;
;; This package provides a function that makes the filenames of a a
;; dired buffer editable, by changing the buffer mode (which inhibits
;; all of the commands of dired mode). Here you can edit the names of
;; one or more files and directories, and when you press C-c C-c, the
;; renaming takes effect and you are back to dired mode.
;;
;; Another things you can do with WDired:
;;
;; - To move files to another directory (by typing their path,
;;   absolute or relative, as a part of the new filename).
;;
;; - To change the target of symbolic links.
;;
;; - To change the permission bits of the filenames (in systems with a
;;   working unix-alike `dired-chmod-program'). See and customize the
;;   variable `wdired-allow-to-change-permissions'.  To change a single
;;   char (toggling between its two more usual values) you can press
;;   the space bar over it or left-click the mouse.  To set any char to
;;   an specific value (this includes the SUID, SGID and STI bits) you
;;   can use the key labeled as the letter you want.  Please note that
;;   permissions of the links cannot be changed in that way, because
;;   the change would affect to their targets, and this would not be
;;   WYSIWYG :-).
;;
;; - To mark files for deletion, by deleting their whole filename.

;;; Installation:

;; Add this file (byte-compiling it is recommended) to your load-path.
;; Then add one of these set of lines (or similar ones) to your config:
;;
;; This is the easy way:
;;
;; (require 'wdired)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map "r" 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
;;
;; This is the recommended way for faster Emacs startup time and lower
;; memory consumption:
;;
;; (autoload 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode "wdired")
;; (eval-after-load "dired"
;;           '(lambda ()
;;              (define-key dired-mode-map "r" 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
;;              (define-key dired-mode-map
;;                [menu-bar immediate wdired-change-to-wdired-mode]
;;                '("Edit File Names" . wdired-change-to-wdired-mode))))
;;
;; Type "M-x customize-group RET wdired" if you want to make changes
;; to the default behavior.

;;; Usage:

;; Then, you can start editing the names of the files by typing "r"
;; (or whatever key you choose, or M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode).
;; Use C-c C-c when finished or C-c C-k to abort. You can use also the
;; menu options: in dired mode, "Edit File Names" under "Immediate".
;; While editing the names, a new submenu "WDired" is available at top
;; level. You can customize the behavior of this package from this
;; menu.

;;; Change Log:

;; Google is your friend (previous versions with complete changelogs
;; were posted to gnu.emacs.sources)
