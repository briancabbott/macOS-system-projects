;;; Commentary:

;; This mode uses the Keywords library header to provide code-finding
;; services by keyword.
;;
;; Things to do:
;;    1. Support multiple keywords per search.  This could be extremely hairy;
;; there doesn't seem to be any way to get completing-read to exit on
;; an EOL with no substring pending, which is what we'd want to end the loop.
;;    2. Search by string in synopsis line?
;;    3. Function to check finder-package-info for unknown keywords.

;;; Code:

(require 'lisp-mnt)
(require 'find-func)			;for find-library(-suffixes)
;; Use `load' rather than `require' so that it doesn't get loaded
;; during byte-compilation (at which point it might be missing).
(load "finder-inf" t t)

  "*Hook run when function `finder-mode' is called.")

;; Local variable in finder buffer.
