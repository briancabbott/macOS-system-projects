* BUILDING EMACS ON MAC OS X

You should be able to build Emacs on Mac OS X by typing the following
commands at the top-level directory after the source distribution is
un-tarred.

  ./configure --enable-carbon-app
  make
  make install

The last step may fail if you do not have permissions to install.  If
you try to install into /usr (with ./configure --prefix=/usr), then you
must install as root using the sudo command.  However, it is not
recommended; see the notes section below for more details.

The --enable-carbon-app specifies that the Carbon GUI application
should be installed into /Applications.  If you want it to install in
a different location, specify --enable-carbon-app=<mydir>

You can type `make bootstrap' instead of `make' to rebuild everything,
including byte-compiling the Lisp files.

If you are compiling on Mac OS X versions before 10.2 and have not
installed the GNU texinfo package on your system, the build will
complain that makeinfo cannot be found.  Instructions for installing the
GNU texinfo package are given below.  Alternatively, you can type `make
-k' instead of `make' and safely ignore the error messages and use the
existing info files.

After Emacs is installed, you can run a text-only terminal version by
typing `emacs' from a terminal (make sure your path contains
/usr/local/bin) or a GUI application by double-clicking on
/Applications/Emacs.app in the Finder.  Even in the terminal version,
some Carbon-specific functions such as `mac-set-file-creator' are
still meaningful.

To start Emacs as a GUI application from the terminal, the pathname to
the executable in the bundle, i.e.,

  /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs

must be typed to the shell to enable Emacs to locate its resources
correctly.  You may want to create an alias to this path to quickly
access both the terminal and GUI versions.  You can specify some
standard Emacs options when invoking Emacs in this way.

Emacs on Mac OS X is not configured to use X11 unless either it is
requested or the use of Carbon is disabled explicitly.  So, if you are
building Emacs to run on X Window System, you need to specify like:

  ./configure --with-x

Note that the Carbon-specific functions mentioned above are not
available on the X11-enabled build.

To use colors in Terminal.app on Mac OS X 10.1, put the following
lines in the file ~/.termcap and log in again.

-----

To build the `info' files in versions prior to Mac OS X 10.2, you need
to install the texinfo software.

To install from source, obtain texinfo-4.2.tar.gz from ftp.gnu.org or
a mirror.  Un-tar it, enter its directory and type

  ./configure
  make
  make install

The last step may need to be performed as root (sudo make install).

You may also like to install ispell, which will allow you to use
ispell and flyspell-mode.  To install ispell from source, you first
need to install GNU textutils.

To do so, download textutils-2.0.tar.gz from ftp.gnu.org or a mirror.
Un-tar it, enter its directory, type

  ./configure --host=powerpc-apple-bsd
  make
  make install

Again, the last step may need to be performed as root.  Note that if you
run `make check', the test for `pr' will fail.

Get and un-tar ispell-3.2.06.tar.gz.  Look for it here:

  http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html

Go into its directory, type

  cp local.h.samp local.h

Add a line `#define TERMLIB ""' to the end of local.h.

Set the environment variable TMPDIR to an existing directory.  For
example since `/tmp' exists on my machine and I am using `bash', I
typed

  export TMPDIR=/tmp

Run `make' and `make install', the latter as root.

* BUILDING BINARY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR MAC OS X

If you are intending to build a binary distribution of Emacs, there is
a script that will greatly simplify the process.  It is called
make-package and it is contained in this directory.  It will generate
a disc image containing a installer bundle.  By default the installer
will place the emacs common files in /usr/local/* and the Carbon
application in /Applications.  Typical usage would be

./make-package

After running, an compressed disk image of the installer will be placed
in a file called EmacsInstaller.dmg.  This file can be then distributed
to whomever would like a binary distribution.  Here are the common
options to user

--with-x         -  Use the X11 GUI instead of the Carbon GUI.
--prefix=DIR     -  Place the common emacs files in the given DIR.  The
		    default is /usr/local.  See note below if placing
		    in /usr
--self-contained -  Place the common emacs files inside the Emacs.app
		    itself.  This makes the application trivial to
		    uninstall and copy between computers.
--app-symlink    -  Use a symlink inside the Application to the
	      	    $prefix/bin/emacs to reduce disk space.  Note, this
		    option may removed in the future.


For usage of other options, use the --help option.

Note: due to the problem "Installing to a directory with non-ASCII
characters in the name fails" mentioned in etc/PROBLEMS, you may not
move a self-contained Emacs.app application bundle to a non-ASCII
directory.

* BUILDING EMACS ON MAC OS Classic

You can use MPW-GM (Aug. 2001) to build Emacs.  MPW-GM can be
downloaded free of charge from Apple.

### IMPORTANT ### You can use StuffIt Expander to decompress and untar
the distribution.  However, you *must* set the radio button in the
Preferences->Cross Platform->Convert text files to Macintosh format to
"Never".  Otherwise the compiled Lisp files will be corrupted.

(Optional) A subset of the fonts from the GNU intlfonts-1.2
distribution converted to NFNT format can be obtained from

  http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi-emacs/stories/Resources/GNU-Fonts.smi.bin

To build Emacs in the MPW Shell, simply set the directory to
...:emacs:mac: and build the target Emacs of the make file
makefile.MPW.  I.e., execute the commands

  make Emacs -f makefile.MPW > Emacs.MakeScript
  Emacs.MakeScript

The above commands create an executable that uses the Carbon API.
The non-Carbon version can also be created by replacing all the
occurrences of `Emacs' above with `NonCarbon'.  Not that the
non-Carbon version does not support some features such as file
dialogs, drag-and-drop, and Unicode menus.

Once built, the Emacs application (Emacs MPW) can be launched where it
is created.

* NOTES

Emacs should build and run on a PowerMac running Mac OS 8.6 - 9.2 (but
only tested on 9.2.2), and Mac OS X 10.1 - 10.4.

You will need around 100 MB of disk space for the source files and
intermediate files.

Under Mac OS Classic, there is no support for building the LEIM
directory.  However, it can be built on Mac OS X or another platform
and transferred to the Mac.

On Mac OS X, installing the emacs files in /usr can cause issues with
system software updates possibly overwriting the distribution.  If this
is a concern, as it should be in normal binary distributions, please
use /usr/local as the prefix for installation.

Emacs supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macintoshes.  However,
due to the unexec process that Emacs uses to dump core, it is not
possible at this time to generate a universal binary that supports both
architectures.  In addition, Rosetta doesn't appear to work correctly
with PowerPC builds of Emacs; you will have to recompile for Intel.
Therefore, builds of Emacs are architecture specific.

Enjoy!
