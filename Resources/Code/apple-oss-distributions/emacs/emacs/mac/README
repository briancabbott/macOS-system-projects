This directory contains the files needed to build Emacs on the Mac OS
Classic and Mac OS X.  Many of the major features of the Unix version
are supported: multiple frames, colors, scroll bars, menu bars, use of
the mouse, fontsets, international characters, input methods, and
coding systems.

Mac OS specific support includes document drag-and-drop in the Finder,
transfer of text to and from other applications via the clipboard, and
sending AppleScript commands to other applications from Emacs.

The following are not supported on Mac OS Classic: unexec (dump-emacs),
asynchronous subprocesses (start-process), and networking
(open-network-stream).  These features work fine on Mac OS X.

There is basic support for synchronous subprocesses (call-process) on
Mac OS Classic (non-Carbon build only) although Unix commands that are
used will need to be ported.

MPW-GM (August 2001) can be used to build Emacs on the Mac OS Classic.
On Mac OS X, Emacs can be built using the Developer Tools.  See the
INSTALL file in this directory for instructions on building Emacs.

Read the Mac OS section of the on-line help to find out about how to
use Emacs on the Mac.

A number of things do not work yet:

+ Support for PostScript image type is not available.

+ Incorporate Apple's wrappers to be able to create a universal 
  binary that unexecs on first run for the given architecture.

If your Mac is connected to the Internet, report bugs by typing `M-x
report-emacs-bug' or by choosing the entry `Send Bug Report...'  in
the `Help' menu.  This will send the bug report to the address
emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org.
