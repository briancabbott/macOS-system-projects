This subdirectory contains the Lucid Widget Library (lwlib), which
provides a uniform interface to a few different X toolkits.  The
library was written by Lucid, Inc and released under the terms of the
GPL version 1 (or later).  It is not considered part of GNU Emacs.

This version of the library differs from the original as described in
the ChangeLog file.  For example, the file "lwlib-int.h" was renamed
from "lwlib-internal.h" in order to fit in 14 characters, and the
makefile adjusted to fit in with Emacs's configure script.
