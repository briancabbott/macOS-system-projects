@node Introduction
@unnumbered Introduction

This manual contains detailed information about various features that
are too specialized to be included in the printed Emacs manual.  It is
intended to be readable by anyone having a basic knowledge of Emacs.
However, certain sections may be intended for a more specialized
audience, such as Elisp authors.  This should be clearly pointed out
at the beginning of these sections.

Certain packages, or collections of related features, have their own
manuals, separate from the main Emacs User's manual.  This manual is
intended as a complement, rather than an alternative, to reading those
additional manuals; in a nutshell, it is a collection of smaller
specialized features, too small or too obscure to justify their own
manual.

Sections intended specifically for Elisp programmers can follow the
style of the Elisp manual.  Other sections should follow the style of
the Emacs manual.
