GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters
to macros).  `m4' also has built-in functions for including files,
running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU
`m4' for generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

GNU `m4' was originally written by Rene' Seindal, from Denmark.
This release is considered stable.

If GNU `m4' is meant to serve GNU `autoconf', beware that `m4'
should be fully installed *prior to* configuring `autoconf' itself.

In the subdirectory `examples' you will find various m4 files, ranging
from trivial test files to rather advanced macros.  If you intend to
use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down there.

See file `BACKLOG' for a summary of pending mail and articles.
See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions.
See file `NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release.
See file `THANKS' for a list of contributors.

By using `./configure --enable-changeword', you get an experimental
feature which allows for changing the syntax of what is a "word" in
`m4'.  This feature will not be present in m4 2.0, but will be
replaced by other new features which provide the same capability, so
do not count on it.

Send bug reports to `bug-m4@gnu.org'.  A bug report is an adequate
description of the problem: your input, what you expected, what you got,
and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but they only describe a
solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to infer.
