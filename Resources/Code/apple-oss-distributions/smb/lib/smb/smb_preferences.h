 *
 * This file contains all the information you should need to manipulate the SMB 
 * subsystem preferences.
 *
 * This file is available as
 *    /usr/local/include/smb_preferences.h
 *
 * To alter the preferences, use the SCPreferences API from the
 * SystemConfiguration framework. These changes are automatically synchronized
 * back to the SMB subsystem configuration file. The necessary system daemons are
 * automatically started or stopped depending on the configuration, so you
 * should not be manipulating these directly.
 *
 * If you need any features or extra preferences or documentation, please
 * file a Radar against the "SMB (New Bugs)" component.
 *
 * Defaults for all the values listed here are provided in two separate
 * plists, one for Desktop and one for Server. If you need to display a value
 * that is not specified in the SCPreferences, you can take it from the
 * appropriate defaults plist.
