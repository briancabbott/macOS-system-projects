High priority:

- Get status messages out of StartupParameters.plist and into the scripts as they progress.  (Radar 2794954)

- Get success/failure messages from startup items.  (Right now, SystemStarter assumes success.)

Medium priority:

- Need to encompass the role of /etc/rc*.
  - In particular, UI progress during fsck of / would be very nice.

- Get rid of hardcoded sizes for boot panel PDF.

Low priority:

- Get the running status of a service without having run it in SystemStarter.
  This is useful for properly re-running SystemStarter and implementing stop.

- Search /Network when available.
