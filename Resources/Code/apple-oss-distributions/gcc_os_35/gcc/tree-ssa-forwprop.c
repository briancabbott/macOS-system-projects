/* This pass performs simple forward propagation of single use variables
   from their definition site into their single use site.

   Right now we only bother forward propagating into COND_EXPRs since those
   are relatively common cases where forward propagation creates valid
   gimple code without the expression needing to fold.  i.e.

     bb0:
       x = a COND b;
       if (x) goto ... else goto ...

   Will be transformed into:

     bb0:
       if (a COND b) goto ... else goto ...
 
   Similarly for the tests (x == 0), (x != 0), (x == 1) and (x != 1).

   Or (assuming c1 and c2 are constants):

     bb0:
       x = a + c1;  
       if (x EQ/NEQ c2) goto ... else goto ...

   Will be transformed into:

     bb0:
        if (a EQ/NEQ (c2 - c1)) goto ... else goto ...

   Similarly for x = a - c1.
    
   Or

     bb0:
       x = !a
       if (x) goto ... else goto ...

   Will be transformed into:

     bb0:
        if (a == 0) goto ... else goto ...

   Similarly for the tests (x == 0), (x != 0), (x == 1) and (x != 1).
   For these cases, we propagate A into all, possibly more than one,
   COND_EXPRs that use X.

   Or

     bb0:
       x = (typecast) a
       if (x) goto ... else goto ...

   Will be transformed into:

     bb0:
        if (a != 0) goto ... else goto ...

   (Assuming a is an integral type and x is a boolean or x is an
    integral and a is a boolean.)

   Similarly for the tests (x == 0), (x != 0), (x == 1) and (x != 1).
   For these cases, we propagate A into all, possibly more than one,
   COND_EXPRs that use X.

   In addition to eliminating the variable and the statement which assigns
   a value to the variable, we may be able to later thread the jump without
   adding insane complexity in the dominator optimizer. 

   Also note these transformations can cascade.  We handle this by having
   a worklist of COND_EXPR statements to examine.  As we make a change to
   a statement, we put it back on the worklist to examine on the next
   iteration of the main loop.

   This will (of course) be extended as other needs arise.  */
