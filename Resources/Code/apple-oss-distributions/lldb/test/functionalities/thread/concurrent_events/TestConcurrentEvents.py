"""
A stress-test of sorts for LLDB's handling of threads in the inferior.

This test sets a breakpoint in the main thread where test parameters (numbers of
threads) can be adjusted, runs the inferior to that point, and modifies the
locals that control the event thread counts. This test also sets a breakpoint in
breakpoint_func (the function executed by each 'breakpoint' thread) and a
watchpoint on a global modified in watchpoint_func. The inferior is continued
until exit or a crash takes place, and the number of events seen by LLDB is
verified to match the expected number of events.
