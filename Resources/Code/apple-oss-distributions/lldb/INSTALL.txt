LLDB Installation Instructions
==============================

LLDB builds on Mac OS X (with Xcode) and Linux (with GCC or Clang).

On Mac OS X, in addition to using Xcode you'll need to enable code signing
on your system to either build lldb or debug using lldb.  Please see the code
signing documentation in docs/code-signing.txt for more detailed directions.

For instructions to build LLDB on Linux, or more details about supported
compiler versions, other dependencies, and build flags, see:
