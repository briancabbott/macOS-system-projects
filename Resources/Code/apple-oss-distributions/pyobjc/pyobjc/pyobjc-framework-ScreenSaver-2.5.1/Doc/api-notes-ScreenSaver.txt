API Notes: ScreenSaver framework
================================

API Notes
---------

The PyObjC bindings for the ScreenSaver framework are complete. The
API for this framework is described in the `Screen Saver framework Reference on Apple's site`_


Platform limitations
--------------------

Screen savers are plugins for the screen saver engine, this means
that a screen saver must contain compiled C code for the correct
architectures. 

On Mac OS X 10.6 and Mac OS X 10.7 you cannot use PyObjC to write a screen saver
because the screen saver engine uses Objetive-C Garbage Collection and
that is not supported by PyObjC. 

Screen savers work again in OS X 10.8.

For OSX 10.6 or later on Intel CPUs the binary must contain support
for the x86_64 (64-bit Intel) code, on earlier OSX releases support
for i386 (32-bit Intel) is needed.

See the section on "Binary Compatibility" in `Apple's documentation`_
for more information.
