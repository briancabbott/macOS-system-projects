API Notes: OpenDirectory and CFOpenDirectory frameworks
=======================================================

API Notes
---------

Both the OpenDirectory framework and the embedded CFOpenDirectory framework are fully wrapped
and can be used as described in the generic PyObjC documentation.

ODQuerySetCallback
..................

The callback function is stored by the framework, the callable can therefore not be
a generic callable, but must be a callable that is annotated using the ``objc.callbackFor``
decorator::

   @objc.callbackFor("CFOpenDirectory.ODQuerySetCallback")
   def query_callback(query, value, context, error, info):
      pass

The ``userInfo`` argument needs to be an integer.
