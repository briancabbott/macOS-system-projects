API Notes: AddressBook framework
================================

API Notes
---------

Plugin API
..........

The C API for creating plugin bundles is not supported. Use the Objective-C API instead.

ABPeoplePicker C API
....................

``ABPickerSetDelegate`` and ``ABPickerGetDelegate`` use an API that isn't 
wrapped by PyObjC.

The C API has some problems on Snow Leopard, use the Object-Oriented API instead.
