.. module:: PyObjCTools.TestSupport
   :synopsis: Testing helpers

This module provides classes and functions that are
usefull for testing PyObjC itself including the framework
wrappers.

.. warning::

   This module is primarily used for testing PyObjC 
   and the API isn't fully stable.


.. function:: sdkForPython()

   Returns the SDK version used to compile Python,
   or :data:`None` when no version can be calculated.

   The SDK version is a tupel with the major
   and minor versions of Mac OS X (for example ``(10, 8)``).

.. function:: fourcc(value)

   Returns the integer value of a four character code
   "literal".

   The *value* is a byte string of length 4 and contains
   the contents of the :c:type:`char` C literal with 
   the four character code, for example ``b"abcd"``.

.. function:: cast_int(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 4 byte integer (using
   the overflow behavior of most CPUs)

.. function:: cast_longlong(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 8 byte integer (using
   the overflow behavior of most CPUs)


.. function:: cast_uint(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 4 byte unsigned integer (
   using the overflow behavior of C)

.. function:: cast_ulonglong(value)

   Return *value* as if it were a 8 byte unsigned integer (using
   the overflow behavior of C)

.. function:: os_release()

   Returns the major release of Mac OS X on the current machine,
   for example "10.5" on all systems running a version 
   of Leopard.

.. function:: is32Bit()

   Returns :data:`True` if the proces is in 32-bit mode.

.. function:: onlyIf(expr, message)

   Decorator for enabling tests only when an expression is true. This is
   the same as :func:`skipUnless <unittest.skipUnless>` in Python 2.7 or later.

.. function:: onlyPython2

   Decorator for enabling a test only when using Python 2.x.

   This is basicly ``onlyIf(sys.version_info[0] == 2)``.

.. function:: onlyPython3

   Decorator for enabling a test only when using Python 3.x.

   This is basicly ``onlyIf(sys.version_info[0] == 3)``.

.. function:: onlyOn32Bit

   Decorator for enabling a test only when the process is running in 32-bit mode.

.. function:: onlyOn64Bit

   Decorator for enabling a test only when the process is running in 64-bit mode.

.. function:: min_os_level(version)

   Decorator for enabling a test only when running on a recent enough release
   of Mac OS X.


.. function:: max_os_level(version)

   Decorator for enabling a test only when running on a old enough release
   of Mac OS X.

.. class:: filterWarnings(kind, category)

   A with-statement context that adds a filter to the warnings module
   while the body of the statement is running.

   This is similar to :class:`warnings.catch_warnings`.


.. _`leaks(1)`: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/leaks.1.html

.. class:: TestCase

   A subclass of :class:`unittest.TestCase` with some addition functionality. The
   most important addition is that each test gets run with a fresh autorelease pool.

   .. method:: run()

      Calls :meth:`unitest.TestCase.run`, but ensures that there is a fresh 
      autorelease pool for every test. This makes is less likely that two
      tests accidenty influence each other.

      There will not be a fresh autorelease pool when :envvar:`PYOBJC_NO_AUTORELEASE`
      is in the shell environment.


      .. versionchanged:: 2.5
         Removed support for using the `leaks(1)`_ tool to check for memory leaks because
         that support was broken (cause test hangs) and didn't properly report leaks. This
         used to environment variable :envvar:`PyOBJC_USE_LEAKS` as a trigger to enable the
         functionality.
