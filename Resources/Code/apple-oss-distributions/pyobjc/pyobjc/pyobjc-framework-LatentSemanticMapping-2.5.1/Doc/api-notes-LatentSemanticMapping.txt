API Notes: LatentSemanticMapping framework
==========================================

API Notes
---------

All functions in this framework are mapped, however the unittests
for this framework wrapper cause crashes in the Python interpreter.

I'm pretty sure that is due to misuse of the API, sadly enough
I haven't found good documentation or examples for the problematic
functions yet. For this reason a large subset of the framework 
interface is not tested at the moment.
