API Notes: ScriptingBridge framework
====================================


Basic usage
-----------

The Objective-C documentation for the scripting bridge frameworks
focusses on static tools for creating proxy classes for scriptable
applications. This is in general not needed when you're programming
in Python.

In Python you can just as easy create a dynamic proxy object::

	iTunes = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier_("com.apple.iTunes")

This can then be used to call "AppleScript" methods, like this::

	print iTunes.currentTrack().name()


API Notes

The PyObjC bindings for the ScriptingBridge framework are
complete.
