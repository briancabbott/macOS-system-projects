API Notes: FSEvents framework
=============================

API Notes
---------

The FSEvents package contains wrappers for the FSEvents API's, which are
part of Carbon and not a standalone framework.

The FSEventsRef type is an opaque pointer, unlike what the name suggests this
is not a CoreFounation based types. As a side-effect of that the programmer
is responsibly for managing the retain-count of objects of this type.

This means you have to call ``FSEventStreamRelease`` when you're done with
a stream. You must not use the stream after that, it will then refer to an
invalid stream.
