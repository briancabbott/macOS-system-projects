"DatePicker" is a Cocoa sample application that demonstrates how to use 
``NSDatePicker`` control on Mac OS X.  ``NSDatePicker`` is a subclass of 
``NSControl`` that provides for visually displaying and editing an 
``NSDate`` instance.

This control uses an ``NSDatePickerCell`` to implement much of the 
controlâ€™s functionality.
