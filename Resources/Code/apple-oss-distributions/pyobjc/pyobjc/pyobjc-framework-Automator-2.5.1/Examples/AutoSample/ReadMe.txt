Overview
--------

This sample displays a single window containing a list of workflows and a read only ``AMWorkflowView``.  The workflows listed are the ones found in the Application's resources in the folder::

	/AutoSample.app/Contents/Resources/workflows/

When the application starts up it scans the workflows folder and loads each Automator workflow found there as an instance of ``AMWorkflow``.  It then stores these ``AMWorkflow`` instances in an array along with the file names.  That array is used as the backing store for the ``NSTableView`` in the window.  

When a click is received on the name of a workflow in the ``NSTableView``, the workflow is displayed in the ``AMWorkflowView`` on the right hand side of the window.

When a double-click is received on the name of a workflow in the ``NSTableView`` (or, when the "run" button is pressed), the selected workflow is displayed in the ``AMWorkflowView`` on the right hand side of the window and it is run.

Initialization Details
----------------------

All of the setup for this sample is performed in the ``-awakeFromNib`` method.  The important features to note there are as follows:

(a) The ``AMWorkflowView`` is being used for display purposes only.  As such, we mark the view as read only by turning off it's editing features with the following method call::

	workflowView.setEditable_(False)

(b) We don't actually manage the ``AMWorkflowView`` ourselves.  Rather, we use an ``AMWorkflowController`` to take care of that.  In this sample, we have added an ``AMWorkflowController`` to our ``.nib`` file and we have set the ``AMWorkflowView`` displayed in the main window as it's ``workFlowView``.  

With this arrangement, our Controller object does not have to worry about the details of operating the ``AMWorkflowView's`` user interface, as the ``AMWorkflowController`` will take care of that. 

So methods in the Controller object can receive information about the status of the view we have set our Controller object as the ``AMWorkflowController's`` delegate.  With our controller object set as the ``AMWorkflowController`` delegate, the ``AMWorkflowController`` will call back to our Controller object to provide status information about the ``AMWorkflow`` it is displaying in the ``AMWorkflowView``.

To run and display specific ``AMWorkflows``, we will want to call methods on the ``AMWorkflowController``.  So we can do that from methods implemented in the Controller object,  we have added an instance variable to the Controller object where we store a reference to the ``AMWorkflowController`` object.

All of these releationships have been set up by control-dragging between objects in the Interface Builder interface.  You can use the connections inspector in Interface Builder to examine these connections.


(c) We allocate and initialize all of the ``AMWorkflow`` instances for the workflows found in our Resources folder and we store them in a ``NSArray``.  It's worth noting that we populate the ``NSArray`` with ``NSDictionary`` records that include the ``AMWorkflow`` instance, the file name, and the path.


(d) we have set up an array controller to manage the contents of the ``NSTableView``.  To do that, we have bound the content array of the array controller to the workflows value stored in our Controller object.  In the column of the table we have bound the value to the ``arrangedObjects`` controller key on the Array Controller.  Back in our controller object, we have stored a reference to the Array Controller in the ``tableContent`` outlet so we can access its ``arrangedObjects`` value (to allow us to access the values displayed in the table no matter how the user has sorted the list by clicking on the table header). 



``AMWorkflowController`` delegate methods
-----------------------------------------

We implement two ``AMWorkflowController`` delegate methods in this sample.  Namely, ``workflowControllerWillRun:`` and ``workflowControllerDidRun:``.  The first method is called just before a workflow being managed by the ``AMWorkflowController`` is run and the second is called just after it finishes running.  

We use these methods to display the progress bar and to set the internal ``runningWorkflow`` flag.  We use bindings based on the ``runningWorkflow`` flag to display the progress bar, enable the stop button while a workflow is running, and disable the run button while a workflow is running.  Also, we use the ``runningWorkflow`` flag to prevent certain user actions, such as switching the ``AMWorkflowController`` to another workflow, while a workflow is still running.




Running a workflow
------------------

We have set the ``run`` method on the ``AMWorkflowController`` as the target action for the run button.  Bindings based on the ``runningWorkflow`` flag control the availability of this button (by controlling its enabled state) for starting a new workflow.

We have set the ``stop`` method on the ``AMWorkflowController`` as the target action for the stop button.  Bindings based on the ``runningWorkflow`` flag control the availability of this button (by controlling its enabled state) for stopping a new workflow.
