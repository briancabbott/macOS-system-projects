# Note that this file does not stand on its own.  It is included by a
# higher-level Makefile so that Automake features such as "make dist"
# work properly (and include all the relevant files in this directory
# in the distribution tarball).

# If you are looking for the file that builds these examples, look at
# "Makefile" in this same directory (it is *NOT* generated by
# Automake).
