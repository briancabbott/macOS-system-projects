===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of Open MPI since
version 1.0.

1.2.8
-----

- Tweaked one memory barrier in the openib component to be more conservative.
  May fix a problem observed on PPC machines.  See ticket #1532.
- Fix OpenFabrics IB partition support. See ticket #1557.
- Restore v1.1 feature that sourced .profile on remote nodes if the default
  shell will not do so (e.g. /bin/sh and /bin/ksh).  See ticket #1560.
- Fix segfault in MPI_Init_thread() if ompi_mpi_init() fails. See ticket #1562.
- Adjust SLURM support to first look for $SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE instead of
  the deprecated $SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE environment variable.  This change
  may be *required* when using SLURM v1.2 and above.  See ticket #1536.
- Fix the MPIR_Proctable to be in process rank order. See ticket #1529.
- Fix a regession introduced in 1.2.6 for the IBM eHCA. See ticket #1526.

- Added tight integration with Sun N1 Grid Engine (N1GE) 6 and the
  open source Grid Engine.
- Allow building the F90 MPI bindings as shared libraries for most

  tokens.  Thanks to Orion Poplawski for identifying the problem and
  to Ralf Wildenhues for suggesting the fix.

1.1
---

- Various MPI datatype fixes, optimizations.
- Fixed various problems on the SPARC architecture (e.g., not
  correctly aligning addresses within structs).
- Improvements in various run-time error messages to be more clear
  about what they mean and where the errors are occurring.
- Various fixes to mpirun's handling of --prefix.
- Updates and fixes for Cray/Red Storm support.
- Major improvements to the Fortran 90 MPI bindings:
  - General improvements in compile/linking time and portability
    between different F90 compilers.
  - Addition of "trivial", "small" (the default), and "medium"
    Fortran 90 MPI module sizes (v1.0.x's F90 module was
    equivalent to "medium").  See the README file for more
    explanation.
  - Fix various MPI F90 interface functions and constant types to
    match.  Thanks to Michael Kluskens for pointing out the problems
    to us.
- Allow short messagees to use RDMA (vs. send/receive semantics) to a
  limited number peers in both the mvapi and openib BTL components.
  This reduces communication latency over IB channels.
- Numerous performance improvements throughout the entire code base.
- Many minor threading fixes.
- Add a define OMPI_SKIP_CXX to allow the user to skip the mpicxx.h from
  being included in mpi.h. It allows the user to compile C code with a CXX
  compiler without including the CXX bindings.
- PERUSE support has been added. In order to activate it add
  --enable-peruse to the configure options. All events described in
  the PERUSE 2.0 draft are supported, plus one Open MPI
  extension. PERUSE_COMM_REQ_XFER_CONTINUE allow to see how the data
  is segmented internally, using multiple interfaces or the pipeline
  engine. However, this version only support one event of each type
  simultaneously attached to a communicator.

  different representations of C++ bool and Fortran LOGICAL.
  Mismatched sizes for other datatypes is not supported.
- Open MPI now includes an implementation of the MPI-2 One-Sided
  Communications specification.
- Open MPI is now configurable in cross-compilation environments.
  Several Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 tests need to be pre-seeded with
  results from a config.cache-like file.

  functions (MPI_TESTSOME, MPI_TESTANY, MPI_TESTALL, MPI_WAITSOME,
  MPI_WAITANY, MPI_WAITALL).
- Better handling in MPI_ABORT for when peer processes have already
  died, especially under some resource managers.
- Random updates to README file, to include notes about the Portland
  compilers.
- Random, small threading fixes to prevent deadlock.
- Fixed a problem with handling long mpirun app files.  Thanks to Ravi
  Manumachu for identifying the problem.

  MPI_LOR, MPI_LXOR.  Thanks to Andy Selle for pointing this out to us.
- Fixed TCP BTL network matching logic during MPI_INIT; in some cases
  on multi-NIC nodes, a NIC could get paired with a NIC on another
  network (typically resulting in deadlock).  Thanks to Ken Mighell
  for pointing this out to us.
- Change the behavior of orterun (mpirun, mpirexec) to search for
  argv[0] and the cwd on the target node (i.e., the node where the
  executable will be running in all systems except BProc, where the
  searches are run on the node where orterun is invoked).
- Fix race condition in shared memory transport that could cause
  crashes on machines with weak memory consistency models (including
  POWER/PowerPC machines).
- Fix warnings about setting read-only MCA parameters on bproc systems.
- Change the exit status set by mpirun when an application process is
  killed by a signal.  The exit status is now set to signo + 128, which
  conforms with the behavior of (almost) all shells.
- Correct a datatype problem with the convertor when partially
  unpacking data. Now we can position the convertor to any position
  not only on the predefined types boundaries. Thanks to Yvan Fournier
  for reporting this to us.
- Fix a number of standard I/O forwarding issues, including the
  ability to background mpirun and a loss of data issue when
  redirecting mpirun's standard input from a file.

- Fix parsing problem with mpirun's "-tv" switch.  Thanks to Chris
  Gottbrath for supplying the fix.
- Fix Darwin net/if.h configure warning.
- The GNU assembler unbelievably defaults to making stacks executable.
  So when using gas, add flags to explicitly tell it to not make
  stacks executable (lame but necessary).
- Add missing MPI::Request::Get_status() methods.  Thanks to Bill
  Saphir for pointing this out to us.

  using high-speed networks).
- Open IB support now checks firmware for how many outstanding RDMA
  requests are supported.  Thanks to Mellanox for pointing this out to

  causes problems for some C++ parsers.  Thanks to Martin Audet for
  bringing this to our attention.
