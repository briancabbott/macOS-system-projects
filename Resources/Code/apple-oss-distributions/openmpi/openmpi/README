===========================================================================

The following abbreviated list of release notes applies to this code
base as of this writing (19 September 2007):

- Open MPI includes support for a wide variety of supplemental
  hardware and software package.  When configuring Open MPI, you may
  need to supply additional flags to the "configure" script in order
  to tell Open MPI where the header files, libraries, and any other
  required files are located.  As such, running "configure" by itself
  may include support for all the devices (etc.) that you expect,
  especially if their support headers / libraries are installed in
  non-standard locations.  Network interconnects are an easy example
  to discuss -- Myrinet and InfiniBand, for example, both have
  supplemental headers and libraries that must be found before Open
  MPI can build support for them.  You must specify where these files
  are with the appropriate options to configure.  See the listing of
  configure command-line switches, below, for more details.

- The Open MPI installation must be in your PATH on all nodes (and
  potentially LD_LIBRARY_PATH, if libmpi is a shared library), unless
  using the --prefix or --enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default
  functionality (see below).

- LAM/MPI-like mpirun notation of "C" and "N" is not yet supported.

- Striping MPI messages across multiple networks is supported (and
  happens automatically when multiple networks are available), but
  needs performance tuning.

- The run-time systems that are currently supported are:
  - rsh / ssh
  - BProc versions 3 and 4 with LSF
  - LoadLeveler
  - PBS Pro, Open PBS, Torque
  - SLURM
  - XGrid
  - Cray XT-3 and XT-4
  - Sun N1 Grid Engine (N1GE) 6 and open source Grid Engine

- The majority of Open MPI's documentation is here in this file, the
  included man pages, and on the web site FAQ
  (http://www.open-mpi.org/).  This will eventually be supplemented
  with cohesive installation and user documentation files.

- Systems that have been tested are:
  - Linux, 32 bit, with gcc
  - Linux, 64 bit (x86), with gcc
  - OS X (10.4), 32 and 64 bit (i386, PPC, PPC64, x86_64), with gcc
  - Solaris 10 updates 2 and 3, SPARC and AMD, 32 and 64 bit, with Sun
    Studio 10 and 11

- Other systems have been lightly (but not fully tested):
  - Other compilers on Linux, 32 and 64 bit
  - Other 64 bit platforms (e.g., Linux on PPC64)

- Some MCA parameters can be set in a way that renders Open MPI
  inoperable (see notes about MCA parameters later in this file).  In
  particular, some parameters have required options that must be
  included.
  - If specified, the "btl" parameter must include the "self"
    component, or Open MPI will not be able to deliver messages to the
    same rank as the sender.  For example: "mpirun --mca btl tcp,self
    ..."
  - If specified, the "btl_tcp_if_exclude" paramater must include the
    loopback device ("lo" on many Linux platforms), or Open MPI will
    not be able to route MPI messages using the TCP BTL.  For example:
    "mpirun --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,eth1 ..."

- Open MPI does not support the Sparc v8 CPU target, which is the
  default on Sun Solaris.  The v8plus (32 bit) or v9 (64 bit)
  targets must be used to build Open MPI on Solaris.  This can be
  done by including a flag in CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS, and FCFLAGS,
  -xarch=v8plus for the Sun compilers, -mv8plus for GCC.

- At least some versions of the Intel 8.1 compiler seg fault while
  compiling certain Open MPI source code files.  As such, it is not
  supported.

- The Intel 9.0 v20051201 compiler on IA64 platforms seems to have a
  problem with optimizing the ptmalloc2 memory manager component (the
  generated code will segv).  As such, the ptmalloc2 component will
  automatically disable itself if it detects that it is on this
  platform/compiler combination.  The only effect that this should
  have is that the MCA parameter mpi_leave_pinned will be inoperative.

- Early versions of the Portland Group 6.0 compiler have problems
  creating the C++ MPI bindings as a shared library (e.g., v6.0-1).
  Tests with later versions show that this has been fixed (e.g.,
  v6.0-5).

- The Portland Group compilers prior to version 7.0 require the
  "-Msignextend" compiler flag to extend the sign bit when converting
  from a shorter to longer integer.  This is is different than other
  compilers (such as GNU).  When compiling Open MPI with the Portland
  compiler suite, the following flags should be passed to Open MPI's
  configure script:

  shell$ ./configure CFLAGS=-Msignextend CXXFLAGS=-Msignextend \
	--with-wrapper-cflags=-Msignextend \
	--with-wrapper-cxxflags=-Msignextend ...

  This will both compile Open MPI with the proper compile flags and
  also automatically add "-Msignextend" when the C and C++ MPI wrapper
  compilers are used to compile user MPI applications.

- Open MPI will build bindings suitable for all common forms of
  Fortran 77 compiler symbol mangling on platforms that support it
  (e.g., Linux).  On platforms that do not support weak symbols (e.g.,
  OS X), Open MPI will build Fortran 77 bindings just for the compiler
  that Open MPI was configured with.  

  Hence, on platforms that support it, if you configure Open MPI with
  a Fortran 77 compiler that uses one symbol mangling scheme, you can
  successfully compile and link MPI Fortran 77 applications with a
  Fortran 77 compiler that uses a different symbol mangling scheme.

  NOTE: For platforms that support the multi-Fortran-compiler bindings
  (i.e., weak symbols are supported), due to limitations in the MPI
  standard and in Fortran compilers, it is not possible to hide these
  differences in all cases.  Specifically, the following two cases may
  not be portable between different Fortran compilers:

  1. The C constants MPI_F_STATUS_IGNORE and MPI_F_STATUSES_IGNORE
     will only compare properly to Fortran applications that were
     created with Fortran compilers that that use the same
     name-mangling scheme as the Fortran compiler that Open MPI was
     configured with.

  2. Fortran compilers may have different values for the logical
     .TRUE. constant.  As such, any MPI function that uses the Fortran
     LOGICAL type may only get .TRUE. values back that correspond to
     the the .TRUE. value of the Fortran compiler that Open MPI was
     configured with.  Note that some Fortran compilers allow forcing
     .TRUE. to be 1 and .FALSE. to be 0.  For example, the Portland
     Group compilers provide the "-Munixlogical" option, and Intel
     compilers (version >= 8.) provide the "-fpscomp logicals" option.

  You can use the ompi_info command to see the Fortran compiler that
  Open MPI was configured with.

- Running on nodes with different endian and/or different datatype
  sizes within a single parallel job is supported in this release.
  However, Open MPI does not resize data when datatypes differ in size
  (for example, sending a 4 byte MPI_DOUBLE and receiving an 8 byte
  MPI_DOUBLE will fail).

- MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE support is included, but is only lightly tested.
  It likely does not work for thread-intensive applications.

- Asynchronous message passing progress using threads can be turned on
  with the --enable-progress-threads option to configure.
  Asynchronous message passing progress is only supported for TCP,
  shared memory, and Myrinet/GM.  Myrinet/GM has only been lightly
  tested.

- The XGrid support is experimental - see the Open MPI FAQ and this
  post on the Open MPI user's mailing list for more information:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2006/01/0539.php

- The OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) software package v1.0
  will not work properly with Open MPI v1.2 (and later) due to how its
  Mellanox InfiniBand plugin driver is created.  The problem is fixed
  OFED v1.1 (and later).

- The use of the mvapi BTL is deprecated.  All new InfiniBand work is
  being done in the openib BTL (i.e., the OpenFabrics driver stack).

- The use of fork() with the openib BTL is only partially supported,
  and only on Linux kernels >= v2.6.15 with libibverbs v1.1 or later
  (first released as part of OFED v1.2).  More complete support will
  be included in a future release of Open MPI (see the OFED 1.2
  distribution for details).

- iWARP support is not yet included in the Open MPI OpenFabrics
  support.

- The Fortran 90 MPI bindings can now be built in one of three sizes
  using --with-mpi-f90-size=SIZE (see description below).  These sizes
  reflect the number of MPI functions included in the "mpi" Fortran 90
  module and therefore which functions will be subject to strict type
  checking.  All functions not included in the Fortran 90 module can
  still be invoked from F90 applications, but will fall back to
  Fortran-77 style checking (i.e., little/none).

  - trivial: Only includes F90-specific functions from MPI-2.  This
    means overloaded versions of MPI_SIZEOF for all the MPI-supported
    F90 intrinsic types.

  - small (default): All the functions in "trivial" plus all MPI
    functions that take no choice buffers (meaning buffers that are
    specified by the user and are of type (void*) in the C bindings --
    generally buffers specified for message passing).  Hence,
    functions like MPI_COMM_RANK are included, but functions like
    MPI_SEND are not.

  - medium: All the functions in "small" plus all MPI functions that
    take one choice buffer (e.g., MPI_SEND, MPI_RECV, ...).  All
    one-choice-buffer functions have overloaded variants for each of
    the MPI-supported Fortran intrinsic types up to the number of
    dimensions specified by --with-f90-max-array-dim (default value is
    4).

  Increasing the size of the F90 module (in order from trivial, small,
  and medium) will generally increase the length of time required to
  compile user MPI applications.  Specifically, "trivial"- and
  "small"-sized F90 modules generally allow user MPI applications to
  be compiled fairly quickly but lose type safety for all MPI
  functions with choice buffers.  "medium"-sized F90 modules generally
  take longer to compile user applications but provide greater type
  safety for MPI functions.

  Note that MPI functions with two choice buffers (e.g., MPI_GATHER)
  are not currently included in Open MPI's F90 interface.  Calls to
  these functions will automatically fall through to Open MPI's F77
  interface.  A "large" size that includes the two choice buffer MPI
  functions is possible in future versions of Open MPI.

- Starting with Open MPI v1.2, there are two MPI network models
  available: "ob1" and "cm".  "ob1" uses the familiar BTL components
  for each supported network.  "cm" introduces MTL components for
  each supported network.

  - "ob1" supports a variety of networks that can be used in
    combination with each other (per OS constraints; e.g., there are
    reports that the GM and OpenFabrics kernel drivers do not operate
    well together):
    - InfiniBand: mVAPI and the OpenFabrics stack
    - Loopback (send-to-self)
    - Myrinet: GM and MX
    - Portals
    - Shared memory
    - TCP
    - uDAPL

  - "cm" supports a smaller number of networks (and they cannot be
    used together), but may provide better better overall MPI
    performance:
    - Myrinet MX (not GM)
    - InfiniPath PSM
    - Portals

  Open MPI will, by default, choose to use "cm" if it finds a
  cm-supported network at run-time.  Users can force the use of ob1 if
  desired by setting the "pml" MCA parameter at run-time:

    shell$ mpirun --mca pml ob1 ...

- The MX support is shared between the 2 internal devices, the MTL
  and the BTL.  MTL stands for Message Transport Layer, while BTL
  stands for Byte Transport Layer.  The design of the BTL interface
  in Open MPI assumes that only naive one-sided communication
  capabilities are provided by the low level communication layers.
  However, modern communication layers such as MX, PSM or Portals,
  natively implement highly-optimized two-sided communication
  semantics.  To leverage these capabilities, Open MPI provides the
  MTL interface to transfer messages rather than bytes.
  The MTL interface implements a shorter code path and lets the
  low-level network library decide which protocol to use, depending
  on message length, internal resources and other parameters
  specific to the interconnect used.  However, Open MPI cannot
  currently use multiple MTL modules at once.  In the case of the
  MX MTL, self and shared memory communications are provided by the
  MX library.  Moreover, the current MX MTL does not support message
  pipelining resulting in lower performances in case of non-contiguous
  data-types.
  In the case of the BTL, MCA parameters allow Open MPI to use our own
  shared memory and self device for increased performance.
  The BTL interface allows multiple devices to be used simultaneously.
  For the MX BTL it is recommended that the first segment (which is
  as a threshold between the eager and the rendezvous protocol) should
  always be at most 4KB, but there is no further restriction on
  the size of subsequent fragments.
  The MX MTL is recommended in the common case for best performance
  on 10G hardware, when most of the data transfers cover contiguous
  memory layouts. The MX BTL is recommended in all other cases, more
  specifically when using multiple interconnects at the same time
  (including TCP), transferring non contiguous data-types or when
  using the DR PML.

===========================================================================

Building Open MPI
-----------------

Open MPI uses a traditional configure script paired with "make" to
build.  Typical installs can be of the pattern:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
shell$ ./configure [...options...]
shell$ make all install
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many available configure options (see "./configure --help"
for a full list); a summary of the more commonly used ones follows:

--prefix=<directory>
  Install Open MPI into the base directory named <directory>.  Hence,
  Open MPI will place its executables in <directory>/bin, its header
  files in <directory>/include, its libraries in <directory>/lib, etc.

--with-gm=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the GM libraries and header files are
  located.  This enables GM support in Open MPI.

--with-gm-libdir=<directory>
  Look in directory for the GM libraries.  By default, Open MPI will
  look in <gm directory>/lib and <gm directory>/lib64, which covers
  most cases.  This option is only needed for special configurations.

--with-mx=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the MX libraries and header files are
  located.  This enables MX support in Open MPI.

--with-mx-libdir=<directory>
  Look in directory for the MX libraries.  By default, Open MPI will
  look in <mx directory>/lib and <mx directory>/lib64, which covers
  most cases.  This option is only needed for special configurations.

--with-mvapi=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the mVAPI libraries and header files are
  located.  This enables mVAPI support in Open MPI (although it is
  deprecated).

--with-mvapi-libdir=<directory>
  Look in directory for the MVAPI libraries.  By default, Open MPI will
  look in <mvapi directory>/lib and <mvapi directory>/lib64, which covers
  most cases.  This option is only needed for special configurations.

--with-openib=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the OpenFabrics (previously known as
  OpenIB) libraries and header files are located.  This enables
  OpenFabrics support in Open MPI.

--with-openib-libdir=<directory>
  Look in directory for the OpenFabrics libraries.  By default, Open
  MPI will look in <openib directory>/lib and <openib
  directory>/lib64, which covers most cases.  This option is only
  needed for special configurations.

--with-psm=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the QLogic PSM library and header files
  are located.  This enables InfiniPath support in Open MPI.

--with-psm-libdir=<directory>
  Look in directory for the PSM libraries.  By default, Open MPI will
  look in <psm directory>/lib and <psm directory>/lib64, which covers
  most cases.  This option is only needed for special configurations.

--with-udapl=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the UDAPL libraries and header files are
  located.  This enables UDAPL support in Open MPI.  Note that UDAPL
  support is disabled by default on Linux; the --with-udapl flag must
  be specified in order to enable it.

--with-udapl-libdir=<directory>
  Look in directory for the UDAPL libraries.  By default, Open MPI
  will look in <udapl directory>/lib and <udapl directory>/lib64,
  which covers most cases.  This option is only needed for special
  configurations.

--with-tm=<directory>
  Specify the directory where the TM libraries and header files are
  located.  This enables PBS / Torque support in Open MPI.

--with-mpi-param_check(=value)
  "value" can be one of: always, never, runtime.  If --with-mpi-param
  is not specified, "runtime" is the default.  If --with-mpi-param
  is specified with no value, "always" is used.  Using
  --without-mpi-param-check is equivalent to "never".

  - always: the parameters of MPI functions are always checked for
    errors 
  - never: the parameters of MPI functions are never checked for
    errors 
  - runtime: whether the parameters of MPI functions are checked
    depends on the value of the MCA parameter mpi_param_check
    (default: yes).

--with-threads=value
  Since thread support (both support for MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE and
  asynchronous progress) is only partially tested, it is disabled by
  default.  To enable threading, use "--with-threads=posix".  This is
  most useful when combined with --enable-mpi-threads and/or
  --enable-progress-threads.

--enable-mpi-threads
  Allows the MPI thread level MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.  See
  --with-threads; this is currently disabled by default.

--enable-progress-threads
  Allows asynchronous progress in some transports.  See
  --with-threads; this is currently disabled by default.

--disable-mpi-cxx
  Disable building the C++ MPI bindings.  Note that this does *not*
  disable the C++ checks during configure; some of Open MPI's tools
  are written in C++ and therefore require a C++ compiler to be built.

--disable-mpi-cxx-seek
  Disable the MPI::SEEK_* constants.  Due to a problem with the MPI-2
  specification, these constants can conflict with system-level SEEK_*
  constants.  Open MPI attempts to work around this problem, but the
  workaround may fail in some esoteric situations.  The
  --disable-mpi-cxx-seek switch disables Open MPI's workarounds (and
  therefore the MPI::SEEK_* constants will be unavailable).

--disable-mpi-f77
  Disable building the Fortran 77 MPI bindings.

--disable-mpi-f90
  Disable building the Fortran 90 MPI bindings.  Also related to the
  --with-f90-max-array-dim and --with-mpi-f90-size options.

--with-mpi-f90-size=<SIZE>
  Three sizes of the MPI F90 module can be built: trivial (only a
  handful of MPI-2 F90-specific functions are included in the F90
  module), small (trivial + all MPI functions that take no choice
  buffers), and medium (small + all MPI functions that take 1 choice
  buffer).  This parameter is only used if the F90 bindings are
  enabled.

--with-f90-max-array-dim=<DIM>
  The F90 MPI bindings are strictly typed, even including the number of
  dimensions for arrays for MPI choice buffer parameters.  Open MPI
  generates these bindings at compile time with a maximum number of
  dimensions as specified by this parameter.  The default value is 4.

--enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default
  This option forces the "mpirun" command to always behave as if
  "--prefix $prefix" was present on the command line (where $prefix is
  the value given to the --prefix option to configure).  This prevents
  most rsh/ssh-based users from needing to modify their shell startup
  files to set the PATH and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Open MPI on remote
  nodes.  Note, however, that such users may still desire to set PATH
  -- perhaps even in their shell startup files -- so that executables
  such as mpicc and mpirun can be found without needing to type long
  path names.  --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default is a synonym for
  this option.

--disable-shared
  By default, libmpi is built as a shared library, and all components
  are built as dynamic shared objects (DSOs).  This switch disables
  this default; it is really only useful when used with
  --enable-static.  Specifically, this option does *not* imply
  --disable-shared; enabling static libraries and disabling shared
  libraries are two independent options.

--enable-static
  Build libmpi as a static library, and statically link in all
  components.  Note that this option does *not* imply
  --disable-shared; enabling static libraries and disabling shared
  libraries are two independent options.

There are many other options available -- see "./configure --help".

Changing the compilers that Open MPI uses to build itself uses the
standard Autoconf mechanism of setting special environment variables
either before invoking configure or on the configure command line.
The following environment variables are recognized by configure:

CC          - C compiler to use
CFLAGS      - Compile flags to pass to the C compiler
CPPFLAGS    - Preprocessor flags to pass to the C compiler

CXX         - C++ compiler to use
CXXFLAGS    - Compile flags to pass to the C++ compiler
CXXCPPFLAGS - Preprocessor flags to pass to the C++ compiler

F77         - Fortran 77 compiler to use
FFLAGS      - Compile flags to pass to the Fortran 77 compiler

FC          - Fortran 90 compiler to use
FCFLAGS     - Compile flags to pass to the Fortran 90 compiler

LDFLAGS     - Linker flags to pass to all compilers
LIBS        - Libraries to pass to all compilers (it is rarely
              necessary for users to need to specify additional LIBS)

For example:

shell$ ./configure CC=mycc CXX=myc++ F77=myf77 F90=myf90 ...

It is required that the compilers specified be compile and link
compatible, meaning that object files created by one compiler must be
able to be linked with object files from the other compilers and
produce correctly functioning executables.

Open MPI supports all the "make" targets that are provided by GNU
Automake, such as:

all       - build the entire Open MPI package
install   - install Open MPI
uninstall - remove all traces of Open MPI from the $prefix
clean     - clean out the build tree

Once Open MPI has been built and installed, it is safe to run "make
clean" and/or remove the entire build tree.

VPATH builds are fully supported.

Generally speaking, the only thing that users need to do to use Open
MPI is ensure that <prefix>/bin is in their PATH and <prefix>/lib is
in their LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Users may need to ensure to set the PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in their shell setup files (e.g., .bashrc, .cshrc)
so that rsh/ssh-based logins will be able to find the Open MPI
executables.

===========================================================================

Checking Your Open MPI Installation
-----------------------------------

The "ompi_info" command can be used to check the status of your Open
MPI installation (located in <prefix>/bin/ompi_info).  Running it with
no arguments provides a summary of information about your Open MPI
installation.   

Note that the ompi_info command is extremely helpful in determining
which components are installed as well as listing all the run-time
settable parameters that are available in each component (as well as
their default values).

The following options may be helpful:

--all       Show a *lot* of information about your Open MPI
            installation. 
--parsable  Display all the information in an easily
            grep/cut/awk/sed-able format.
--param <framework> <component>
            A <framework> of "all" and a <component> of "all" will
            show all parameters to all components.  Otherwise, the
            parameters of all the components in a specific framework,
            or just the parameters of a specific component can be
            displayed by using an appropriate <framework> and/or
            <component> name.

Changing the values of these parameters is explained in the "The
Modular Component Architecture (MCA)" section, below.

===========================================================================

Compiling Open MPI Applications
-------------------------------

Open MPI provides "wrapper" compilers that should be used for
compiling MPI applications:

C:          mpicc
C++:        mpiCC (or mpic++ if your filesystem is case-insensitive)
Fortran 77: mpif77
Fortran 90: mpif90

For example:

shell$ mpicc hello_world_mpi.c -o hello_world_mpi -g
shell$

All the wrapper compilers do is add a variety of compiler and linker
flags to the command line and then invoke a back-end compiler.  To be
specific: the wrapper compilers do not parse source code at all; they
are solely command-line manipulators, and have nothing to do with the
actual compilation or linking of programs.  The end result is an MPI
executable that is properly linked to all the relevant libraries.

===========================================================================

Running Open MPI Applications
-----------------------------

Open MPI supports both mpirun and mpiexec (they are exactly
equivalent).  For example:

shell$ mpirun -np 2 hello_world_mpi

or

shell$ mpiexec -np 1 hello_world_mpi : -np 1 hello_world_mpi

are equivalent.  Some of mpiexec's switches (such as -host and -arch)
are not yet functional, although they will not error if you try to use
them.  

The rsh launcher accepts a -hostfile parameter (the option
"-machinefile" is equivalent); you can specify a -hostfile parameter
indicating an standard mpirun-style hostfile (one hostname per line):

shell$ mpirun -hostfile my_hostfile -np 2 hello_world_mpi

If you intend to run more than one process on a node, the hostfile can
use the "slots" attribute.  If "slots" is not specified, a count of 1
is assumed.  For example, using the following hostfile:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
node1.example.com
node2.example.com
node3.example.com slots=2
node4.example.com slots=4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

shell$ mpirun -hostfile my_hostfile -np 8 hello_world_mpi

will launch MPI_COMM_WORLD rank 0 on node1, rank 1 on node2, ranks 2
and 3 on node3, and ranks 4 through 7 on node4.

Other starters, such as the batch scheduling environments, do not
require hostfiles (and will ignore the hostfile if it is supplied).
They will also launch as many processes as slots have been allocated
by the scheduler if no "-np" argument has been provided.  For example,
running an interactive SLURM job with 8 processors:

shell$ srun -n 8 -A
shell$ mpirun a.out

The above command will launch 8 copies of a.out in a single
MPI_COMM_WORLD on the processors that were allocated by SLURM.

Note that the values of component parameters can be changed on the
mpirun / mpiexec command line.  This is explained in the section
below, "The Modular Component Architecture (MCA)".

===========================================================================

The Modular Component Architecture (MCA)

The MCA is the backbone of Open MPI -- most services and functionality
are implemented through MCA components.  Here is a list of all the
component frameworks in Open MPI:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI component frameworks:
-------------------------

allocator - Memory allocator
bml       - BTL management layer
btl       - MPI point-to-point byte transfer layer, used for MPI
            point-to-point messages on some types of networks
coll      - MPI collective algorithms
io        - MPI-2 I/O
mpool     - Memory pooling
mtl       - Matching transport layer, used for MPI point-to-point
            messages on some types of networks
osc       - MPI-2 one-sided communications
pml       - MPI point-to-point management layer
rcache    - Memory registration cache
topo      - MPI topology routines

Back-end run-time environment component frameworks:
---------------------------------------------------

errmgr    - RTE error manager
gpr       - General purpose registry
iof       - I/O forwarding
ns        - Name server
odls      - OpenRTE daemon local launch subsystem
oob       - Out of band messaging
pls       - Process launch system
ras       - Resource allocation system
rds       - Resource discovery system
rmaps     - Resource mapping system
rmgr      - Resource manager
rml       - RTE message layer
schema    - Name schemas
sds       - Startup / discovery service
smr       - State-of-health monitoring subsystem

Miscellaneous frameworks:
-------------------------

backtrace - Debugging call stack backtrace support
maffinity - Memory affinity
memory    - Memory subsystem hooks
memcpy    - Memopy copy support
memory    - Memory management hooks
paffinity - Processor affinity
timer     - High-resolution timers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each framework typically has one or more components that are used at
run-time.  For example, the btl framework is used by MPI to send bytes
across underlying networks.  The tcp btl, for example, sends messages
across TCP-based networks; the gm btl sends messages across GM
Myrinet-based networks.

Each component typically has some tunable parameters that can be
changed at run-time.  Use the ompi_info command to check a component
to see what its tunable parameters are.  For example:

shell$ ompi_info --param btl tcp

shows all the parameters (and default values) for the tcp btl
component.

These values can be overridden at run-time in several ways.  At
run-time, the following locations are examined (in order) for new
values of parameters:

1. <prefix>/etc/openmpi-mca-params.conf

   This file is intended to set any system-wide default MCA parameter
   values -- it will apply, by default, to all users who use this Open
   MPI installation.  The default file that is installed contains many
   comments explaining its format.

2. $HOME/.openmpi/mca-params.conf

   If this file exists, it should be in the same format as
   <prefix>/etc/openmpi-mca-params.conf.  It is intended to provide
   per-user default parameter values.

3. environment variables of the form OMPI_MCA_<name> set equal to a
   <value>

   Where <name> is the name of the parameter.  For example, set the
   variable named OMPI_MCA_btl_tcp_frag_size to the value 65536
   (Bourne-style shells):

   shell$ OMPI_MCA_btl_tcp_frag_size=65536
   shell$ export OMPI_MCA_btl_tcp_frag_size

4. the mpirun command line: --mca <name> <value>
 
   Where <name> is the name of the parameter.  For example:

   shell$ mpirun --mca btl_tcp_frag_size 65536 -np 2 hello_world_mpi

These locations are checked in order.  For example, a parameter value
passed on the mpirun command line will override an environment
variable; an environment variable will override the system-wide
defaults.
