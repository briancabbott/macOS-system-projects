[multiple-prefixes]
Multiple different --prefix options were specified to mpirun for the
same node.  This is a fatal error for the TM (PBS / Torque) process
starter in Open MPI.

The first two prefix values supplied for node %s were:
    %s
and %s
#
[daemon-not-found]
The TM (PBS / Torqus) process starter in Open MPI was unable to find
its daemon executable (orted) on the node where mpirun was executed.  

This sanity check is performed because the back-end PBS / Torque
process launcher does not provide any kind of error to Open MPI if it
tries to launch its daemon on a remote node, but the daemon cannot be
found.  Open MPI's check for the daemon locally is somewhat of a lame
workaround / sanity check.

If you do not understand this error mesage, please try the following:

1. Try to add the Open MPI executables to your PATH
2. Use the --prefix option to mpirun to indicate where Open MPI can
   find its executables
3. Set the MCA parameter "pls_tm_want_path_check" to 0
4. Talk to your local system administration
