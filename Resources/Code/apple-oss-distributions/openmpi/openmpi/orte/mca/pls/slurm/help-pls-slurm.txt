[multiple-prefixes]
The SLURM process starter for Open MPI does not support multiple
different --prefix options to mpirun.  You can specify at most one
unique value for the --prefix option (in any of the application
contexts); it will be applied to all the application contexts of your
parallel job.

Put simply, you must have Open MPI installed in the same location on
all of your SLURM nodes.

Multiple different --prefix options were specified to mpirun.  This is
a fatal error for the SLURM process starter in Open MPI.

The first two prefix values supplied were:
    %s
and %s
