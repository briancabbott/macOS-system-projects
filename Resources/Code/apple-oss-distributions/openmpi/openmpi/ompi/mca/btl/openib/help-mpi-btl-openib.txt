[ini file:file not found]
The Open MPI OpenIB BTL component was unable to find or read an INI
file that was requested via the btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA
parameter.  Please check this file and/or modify the
btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA parameter:

    %s
[ini file:not in a section]
In parsing OpenIB BTL parameter file, values were found that were not
in a valid INI section.  These values will be ignored.  Please
re-check this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:unexpected token]
In parsing OpenIB BTL parameter file, unexpected tokens were found
(this may cause significant portions of the INI file to be ignored).
Please re-check this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:expected equals]
In parsing OpenIB BTL parameter file, unexpected tokens were found
(this may cause significant portions of the INI file to be ignored).
An equals sign ("=") was expected but was not found.  Please re-check
this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:expected newline]
In parsing OpenIB BTL parameter file, unexpected tokens were found
(this may cause significant portions of the INI file to be ignored).
A newline was expected but was not found.  Please re-check this file:

    %s

At line %d, near the following text:

    %s
[ini file:unknown field]
In parsing OpenIB BTL parameter file, an unrecognized field name was
found.  Please re-check this file:

    %s

At line %d, the field named:

    %s

This field, and any other unrecognized fields, will be skipped.
[no hca params found]
WARNING: No HCA parameters were found for the HCA that Open MPI
detected:

    Hostname:           %s
    HCA vendor ID:      0x%04x
    HCA vendor part ID: %d

Default HCA parameters will be used, which may result in lower
performance.  You can edit any of the files specified by the
btl_openib_hca_param_files MCA parameter to set values for your HCA.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_no_hca_params_found to 0.
[init-fail-no-mem]
The OpenIB BTL failed to initialize while trying to allocate some
locked memory.  This typically can indicate that the memlock limits
are set too low.  For most HPC installations, the memlock limits
should be set to "unlimited".  The failure occured here:

    Host:          %s
    OMPI source:   %s:%d
    Function:      %s()
    Device:        %s
    Memlock limit: %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.  This FAQ entry on the Open MPI web site may also be
helpful:

    http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages
[init-fail-create-q]
The OpenIB BTL failed to initialize while trying to create an internal
queue.  This typically indicates a failed OpenFabrics installation or
faulty hardware.  The failure occured here:

    Host:        %s
    OMPI source: %s:%d
    Function:    %s()
    Error:       %s (errno=%d)
    Device:      %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
[btl_openib:retry-exceeded]
The InfiniBand retry count between two MPI processes has been
exceeded.  "Retry count" is defined in the InfiniBand spec 1.2
(section 12.7.38):

    The total number of times that the sender wishes the receiver to
    retry timeout, packet sequence, etc. errors before posting a
    completion error.

This error typically means that there is something awry within the
InfiniBand fabric itself.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.  

Two MCA parameters can be used to control Open MPI's behavior with
respect to the retry count:

* btl_openib_ib_retry_count - The number of times the sender will
  attempt to retry (defaulted to 7, the maximum value).

* btl_openib_ib_timeout - The local ACK timeout parameter (defaulted
  to 10).  The actual timeout value used is calculated as:

     4.096 microseconds * (2^btl_openib_ib_timeout)

  See the InfiniBand spec 1.2 (section 12.7.34) for more details.
[no active ports found]
WARNING: There is at least on IB HCA found on host '%s', but there is
no active ports detected. This is most certainly not what you wanted.
Check your cables and SM configuration.
[error in hca init]
WARNING: There were errors during IB HCA initialization on host '%s'.
[default subnet prefix]
WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host '%s', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.
[ibv_fork requested but not supported]
WARNING: fork() support was requested for the openib BTL, but it is
not supported on the host %s.  Deactivating the openib BTL.
[ibv_fork_init fail]
WARNING: fork() support was requested for the openib BTL, but the
library call ibv_fork_init() failed on the host %s.
Deactivating the openib BTL.
[invalid mca param value]
WARNING: OpenFabric btl paramet configured to illegal value:
