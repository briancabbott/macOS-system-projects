     *
     * This function invokes the selection process for io components,

     *   that component.  (However, in this mode, we may make 2 passes
     *   through the selection process -- more on this below).
     * - All components in the selection set are queried to see if they
     *   want to run with that file handle.  All components that want to
     *   run are ranked by their priority and the highest priority
     *   component is selected.  All non-selected components have their
     *   "unquery" function invoked to let them know that they were not
     *   selected.
     * - The selected module will have its "init" function
     *   invoked to let it know that it was selected.  All unselected
     *   components will have their file_unselect function invoked.
     * - If we fall through this entire process and no component is
     *   selected \em and the \em preferred argument is not NULL, then
     *   run the entire process again as if the \em preferred argument
     *   was NULL (i.e., use the entire available set of components).
     *
     * At the end of this process, we'll either have a single
     * component/module pair that is selected and initialized for the
     * file handle, or no component was selected and an error is
     * returned up the stack.
