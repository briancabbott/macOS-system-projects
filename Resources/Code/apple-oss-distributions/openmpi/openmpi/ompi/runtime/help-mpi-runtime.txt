[mpi_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like %s failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during %s; some of which are due to configuration or environment
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI
developer):

  %s
  --> Returned "%s" (%d) instead of "Success" (0)
[mpi-param-check-enabled-but-compiled-out]
WARNING: The MCA parameter mpi_param_check has been set to true, but
parameter checking has been compiled out of Open MPI.  The
mpi_param_check value has therefore been ignored.
[mpi-params:leave-pinned-and-pipeline-selected]
WARNING: Cannot set both the MCA parameters mpi_leave_pinned and
mpi_leave_pinned_pipeline to "true".  Defaulting to mpi_leave_pinned
ONLY.
[mpi_init:startup:paffinity-unavailable]
The MCA parameter "mpi_paffinity_alone" was set to a nonzero value,
but Open MPI was unable to bind MPI_COMM_WORLD rank %s to a processor.

Typical causes for this problem include:

   - A node was oversubscribed (more processes than processors), in
     which case Open MPI will not bind any processes on that node
   - A startup mechanism was used which did not tell Open MPI which
     processors to bind processes to
[mpi_finalize:invoked_multiple_times]
The function MPI_FINALIZE was invoked multiple times in a single
process on host %s, PID %d.  

This indicates an erroneous MPI program; MPI_FINALIZE is only allowed
to be invoked exactly once in a process.
[proc:heterogeneous-support-unavailable]
The build of Open MPI running on host %s was not 
compiled with heterogeneous support.  A process running on host 
%s appears to have a different architecture,
which will not work.  Please recompile Open MPI with the
configure option --enable-heterogeneous or use a homogeneous
environment.
[THREAD_MULTIPLE and progress threads poorly supported]
**************************** OPEN MPI WARNING ****************************
Open MPI was configured and built with support for progress threads.
Additionally, the application has initialized MPI with
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, indicating that it wants to have full
multi-threaded support in MPI.

Note that the Open MPI v1.2 series has poor/untested support for both
of these features, and only with TCP MPI message passing.  This
functionality is *not* considered to be production quality.

*************************************************************************
*** It is likely that your application will fail (crash, hang, etc.). ***
*** Open MPI will now sleep for 5 seconds to give you the opportunity ***
*** to quit your application.                                         ***
*************************************************************************

You can disable this warning (and the sleep) by setting the following
two MCA parameters to 0:

    mpi_warn_if_thread_multiple
    mpi_warn_if_progress_threads
**************************** OPEN MPI WARNING ****************************
