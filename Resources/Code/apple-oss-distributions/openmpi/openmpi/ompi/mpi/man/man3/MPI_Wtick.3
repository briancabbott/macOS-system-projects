.SH RETURN VALUE
.ft R
Time in seconds of resolution of MPI_Wtime.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
MPI_Wtick returns the resolution of MPI_Wtime in seconds. That is, it returns, as a double-precision value, the number of seconds between successive clock ticks. For example, if the clock is implemented by the hardware as a counter that is incremented every millisecond, the value returned by MPI_Wtick should be 10^-3.

.SH NOTE
This function does not return an error value. Consequently, the result of calling it before MPI_Init or after MPI_Finalize is undefined.
