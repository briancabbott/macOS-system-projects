# This Makefile.am is quite complex and confusing.  Part of the
# problem is that Libtool (v1.5.18) does not understand F90, so we
# have to do a few things manually (and no shared libraries). Here's a
# summary of what is happening:
#
# Depedencies / who generates whom:
#
# configure generates fortran_kinds.sh
#       |
#      \|/
# fortran_kinds.sh ----> sourced by scripts/* ----> generates mpi_*.f90
#                                 |                         |
#                                \|/                        |
#                    generates mpi-f90-interfaces.h         |
#                    /                                      |
#                   \/                                      |
#  mpi-f90-interfaces.h                                     |
#                 |                                         |
#                \|/                                       \|/
#            used by mpi.f90                 used by mpi_*.f90
#           /        |                               |
#          /        \|/                             \|/
#         /  generates mpi.o                 generates mpi_*.o
#        \/                 \               /
# generates mpi module      \/             \/

# ". some_script" in the bar script), it will try to run it in the

# exist; there aren't good portable ways to indicate that the target
# name is fake and should never exist).
