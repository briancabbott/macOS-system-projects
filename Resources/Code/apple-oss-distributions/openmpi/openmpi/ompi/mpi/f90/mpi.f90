module mpi

  include "mpif-common.h"

! The MPI attribute callback functions need to be explictly called out
! so that they don't end up in the MPI namespace.  See a longer
! explanation in attr_fn-f90-interfaces.h.

  include "attr_fn-f90-interfaces.h"

! This file is generated, and is *huge*.  Its size is directly related
! to the --with-f90-max-array-dim configure parameter.
