     *
     * This function invokes the selection process for maffinity
     * components, which works as follows:
     *
     * - If the \em maffinity MCA parameter is not specified, the
     *   selection set is all available maffinity components.
     * - If the \em maffinity MCA parameter is specified, the
     *   selection set is just that component.
     * - All components in the selection set are queried to see if
     *   they want to run.  All components that want to run are ranked
     *   by their priority and the highest priority component is
     *   selected.  All non-selected components have their "close"
     *   function invoked to let them know that they were not selected.
     * - The selected component will have its "init" function invoked to
     *   let it know that it was selected.
     *
     * If we fall through this entire process and no component is
     * selected, then return OPAL_NOT_FOUND (this is not a fatal
     * error).
     *
     * At the end of this process, we'll either have a single
     * component that is selected and initialized, or no component was
     * selected.  If no component was selected, subsequent invocation
     * of the maffinity wrapper functions will return an error.
