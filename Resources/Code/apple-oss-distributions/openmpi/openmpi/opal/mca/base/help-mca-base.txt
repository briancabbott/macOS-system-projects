[find-available:none-found]
No available %s components were found!

This means that there are no components of this type installed on your
system or all the components reported that they could not be used.

This is a fatal error; your MPI process is likely to abort.  Check the
output of the "ompi_info" command and ensure that components of this
type are available on your system.  You may also wish to check the
value of the "component_path" MCA parameter and ensure that it has at
least one directory that contains valid MCA components.

[find-available:not-valid]
The %s component was not found!

This means that this component is either not installed, or unable to be 
used on your system.
[framework-param:too-many-negates]
MCA framework parameters can only take a single negation operator
("^"), and it must be at the beginning of the value.  The following
value violates this rule:

    %s

When used, the negation operator sets the "exclusive" behavior mode,
meaning that it will exclude all specified components (and implicitly
include all others).  If the negation operator is not specified, the
"inclusive" mode is assumed, meaning that all specified components
will be included (and implicitly exclude all others).

For example, "^a,b" specifies the exclusive behavior and means "use
all components *except* a and b", while "c,d" specifies the inclusive
behavior and means "use *only* components c and d."

You cannot mix inclusive and exclusive behavior.
