  Define HAVE_MMAP as true to optionally make malloc() use mmap() to
  allocate very large blocks.  These will be returned to the
  operating system immediately after a free(). Also, if mmap
  is available, it is used as a backup strategy in cases where
  MORECORE fails to provide space from system.

  This malloc is best tuned to work with mmap for large requests.
  If you do not have mmap, operations involving very large chunks (1MB
  or so) may be slower than you'd like.

  malloc_stats();
  Prints on stderr the amount of space obtained from the system (both
  via sbrk and mmap), the maximum amount (which may be more than
  current if malloc_trim and/or munmap got called), and the current
  number of bytes allocated via malloc (or realloc, etc) but not yet
  freed. Note that this is the number of bytes allocated, not the
  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than
  zero even when no user-level chunks are allocated.

  The reported current and maximum system memory can be inaccurate if
  a program makes other calls to system memory allocation functions
  (normally sbrk) outside of malloc.

  malloc_stats prints only the most commonly interesting statistics.
  More information can be obtained by calling mallinfo.
