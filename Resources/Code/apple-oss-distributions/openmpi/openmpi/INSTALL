Developer Builds
================

If you have checked out a DEVELOPER'S COPY of Open MPI (i.e., you
checked out from subversion), you should read the HACKING file before
attempting to build Open MPI.  You must also first run:

shell$ ./autogen.sh 

You will need very recent versions of GNU Autoconf, Automake, and
Libtool.  If autogen.sh fails, read the HACKING file.


User Builds
===========

Building Open MPI is typically a combination of running "configure"
and "make".  Execute the following commands to install the Open MPI
system from within the directory at the top of the tree:

shell$ ./configure --prefix=/where/to/install
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make all install

If you need special access to install, then you can execute "make
all" as a user with write permissions in the build tree, and a
separate "make install" as a user with write permissions to the
install tree.

Compiling support for GM or enabling shared-memory support on selected
Power PC architectures require additional flags to configure.  See the
README file for more details.

Note that VPATH builds are fully supported.  For example:

shell$ gtar zxf openmpi-1.2.3.tar.gz
shell$ cd openmpi-1.2.3
shell$ mkdir build
shell$ cd build
shell$ ../configure ...
[...lots of output...]
shell$ make all install


Compiling MPI Applications
==========================

MPI applications should be compiled using the Open MPI "wrapper"
compilers:

C programs:   mpicc your-code.c
C++ programs: mpiCC your-code.cc    or
              mpic++ your-code.cc   (for case-insensitive filesystems)
F77 programs: mpif77 your-code.f
F90 programs: mpif90 your-code.f90

These compilers simply add various command line flags (such as -lmpi)
and invoke a back-end compiler; they are not compilers in themselves.
