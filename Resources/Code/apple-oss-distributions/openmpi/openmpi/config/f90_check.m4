# OMPI_F90_CHECK(Fortran type, expected size)
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Check Fortran type/kind combinations, including:
# - whether compiler supports or not
# - size of type
# - equal to expected size
# - range (optional)
# - precision (optional)

# Note that we do *not* check for the alignment here.  This is a long,
# sordid tale.

# We have been unable to devise a F90 test that will result in a
# consistent answer.  Specifically, our prior tests have been similar
# to the f77 test -- have a small chunk of f90 code compiled with the
# C code to actually compute the offsets.  The f90 code was a
# struct-like entity (a "type") with multiple members -- on a
# character and the other of the target type.  The C code measured the
# distance between them.  But even if you use the keyword to ensure
# that the F90 compiler does not re-order this struct, you may still
# get a different alignment answer than the F77 test (!).  This is
# apparently because F90 allows compilers to align types differently
# according to use (in common blocks, as standalone variables, and as
# a member of a struct).  Hence, the alignment can be different
# depending on how to measure (and use) it.  This was confirmed by
# various members of the Fortran committee and several Fortran
# compiler vendors.

# We check the F77 alignment based on common block usage, but this is
# only one of the available types for F90.  Hence, we may actually get
# a different answer between f77 and f90 in the same compiler series
# (and some compilers do!  E.g., g95 gives different answers even when
# "g95" itself is used as both the f77 and f90 compiler).

# So we gave up.

# Additionally, this was really only a sanity check anyway, because
# the way out F90 MPI layer is organized, there is no translation
# between the data and datatypes performed -- we simply invoke the F77
# layer from the F90 layer.  Hence, we make no distinction between
# them, and therefore the OMPI DDT engine uses only the F77 sizes and
# alignments.  So rather than display a warning to the user for a test
# that was questionable at best, we just eliminated the F90 alignment
# test, corresponding F77 comparison, and ensuring warning -- because
# it really didn't mean anything anyway.

# types to search is a comma-seperated list of values
