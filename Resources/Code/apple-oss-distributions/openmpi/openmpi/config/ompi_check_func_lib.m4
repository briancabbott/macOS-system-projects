# OMPI_CHECK_FUNC_LIB(func, lib, [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
# ------------------------------
# Try to find function func, first with the present LIBS, second with
# lib added to LIBS.  If func is found with the libraries listed in
# LIBS, no modification to LIBS is made.  If func is in lib (but not
# in LIBS) then lib is added to LIBS.  If func is not in lib, then
# LIBS is not modified.
