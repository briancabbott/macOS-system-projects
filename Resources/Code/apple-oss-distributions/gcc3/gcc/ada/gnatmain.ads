--  This procedure is the project-aware driver for the GNAT tools.
--  For gnatls, gnatxref, gnatfind and gnatstub, it setup the environment
--  variables ADA_INCLUDE_PATH and ADA_OBJECT_PATH and gather the switches
--  and file names from the project file (if any) and from the common line,
--  then call the non project-aware tool (gnatls, gnatxref, gnatfind or
--  gnatstub).
--  For other tools (compiler, binder, linker, gnatmake), it invokes
--  gnatmake with the proper switches.
