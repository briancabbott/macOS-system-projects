   mode_read_binary_plus

   mode_write_binary_plus

   mode_append_binary_plus
   append; open or create binary file for update, writing at end-of-file
   a+b for DOS and Windows NT, a+ for Unix

   Notes:

   (1) Opening a file with read mode fails if the file does not exist or
   cannot be read.

   (2) Opening a file with append mode causes all subsequent writes to the
   file to be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless of
   intervening calls to the fseek function.

   (3) When a file is opened with update mode, both input and output may be
   performed on the associated stream.  However, output may not be directly
   followed by input without an intervening call to the fflush function or
   to a file positioning function (fseek, fsetpos, or rewind), and input
   may not be directly followed by output without an intervening call to a
   file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters
   end-of-file.

   The other target dependent declarations here are for the two functions
   __gnat_set_binary_mode and __gnat_set_text_mode:

      void __gnat_set_binary_mode (int handle);
      void __gnat_set_text_mode   (int handle);

   These functions have no effect in Unix (or similar systems where there is
   no distinction between binary and text files), but in DOS (and similar
   systems where text mode does CR/LF translation), these functions allow
   the mode of the stream with the given handle (fileno can be used to get
   the handle of a stream) to be changed dynamically. The returned result
   is 0 if no error occurs and -1 if an error occurs.

   Finally there is a boolean (character) variable

      char __gnat_text_translation_required;

   which is zero (false) in Unix mode, and one (true) in DOS mode, with a
   true value indicating that text translation is required on text files
   and that fopen supports the trailing t and b modifiers.
