</CENTER>
<P>
	This document describes the Jam/MR language, used
	to defines rules and dependencies for <b>jam</b>,
	the Jam/MR executable program.
	For additional information, please see:
	<UL>
	<LI><a href="Jam.html">The Jam/MR Executable Program</A>
	<LI><a href="Jamfile.html">Using Jamfiles and Jambase</A>
	<LI><A href="Jambase.html">Jambase Reference</A>
	</UL>
<P>
	Also, the Jambase file provided in the Jam/MR distribution
	is an excellent source of Jam/MR language examples.
	Documentation and source are available from

<H3> Lexical Features
</H3>
<P>
       Jam/MR treats its input files as whitespace-separated tokens,
       with two exceptions: double quotes (") can enclose whitespace  to embed it into a token, and everything between the
       matching curly braces ({}) in the  definition  of  a  rule
       action is treated as a single string.  A backslash (\) can
       escape a double quote.
<P>
       Jam/MR requires whitespace (blanks,  tabs,  or  newlines)  to
       surround all tokens, including the colon (:) and semicolon
       (;) tokens.  This is because <b>jam</b> runs  on  many  platforms
       and  no  characters,  save whitespace, are uncommon in the
       file names on all of those platforms.
<P>
<H3> Targets
</H3>
<P>
	The essential Jam/MR data entity is a target.
       Built targets are files to be updated. Source targets are the  files
       used  in  updating  those targets. Pseudotargets are
       symbols which represent dependencies on other targets.
       Built targets and source targets are collectively referred
       to as file targets; pseudotargets are not file targets.
       <P>
       Each target has a unique identifier, which, in the case
       of file targets, is its filename optionally qualified
       with grist (a string value used to
       assure uniqueness) and/or a pathname,
       either rooted or relative to the directory of 
       <b>jam</b>'s
       invocation.  
       A file target with an identifier of the form
       <I>file(member)</I> is an
       an ar(1) library member.
<P>
<H3> Rules
</H3>
<P>
       Jam/MR's basic language entity is called a  rule,  which  is  used  
       primarily to
       relate built targets to their source targets. A rule is defined in two
       parts: the Jam/MR statements to  execute  when  the  rule 
       invocation is parsed, and the actions
       (shell commands) to execute when updating the built targets
       of  the  rule.   A  rule  may have a procedure definition,
       an action definition, or both.
<P>
       The Jam/MR statements for defining and invoking rules are  as
       follows:
       <PRE>
	rule <I>rulename</I> { <I>statements</I> }

	actions [ <I>modifiers</I> ] <I>rulename</I> { <I>commands</I> }

	<I>rulename field1 </I>:<I> field2 </I>:<I> ... </I>:<I> fieldN ;</I>
	</PRE>

<P>
       The  first  form  defines  a  rule's procedure; the second
       defines the rule's updating actions; the third invokes the
       rule.   Redefining  a rule's procedure or actions replaces
       the previous definition.
<P>
	A rule is invoked with values in <I>field1</I> through
	<I>fieldN</I>, which are referenced in the procedure
	definition <I>statements</I> as 
	variables named $(1) through $(<I>N</I>).
	A rule defined with a procedure definition and no action
	definition is just a procedure call.
<P>
	When a rule is invoked, its action definition, if any,
	is automatically the first updating action to be associated
	with targets.
	Any other actions invoked from a rule's procedure definition
	<I>statements</I>
	will be executing during updating in the order
	in which they were invoked.
	Updating actions are associated with the targets in <I>field1</I>.
<P>
	Built targets and source targets are passed to an updating
	action through <I>field1</I> and <I>field2</I>, and
	are refenced in the action's <I>commands</I> as
	$(1) and $(2) respectively.
	$(1) and $(2) may also be referenced as $(<) and $(>)
	in action <I>commands</I> and 
	procedure definition <I>statements</I>. 
	During updating, <I>commands</I> are passed to the OS, with
	$(1) and $(2) replaced by bound targets. (See "Binding" 
	in the <a href="Jam.html">The Jam/MR Executable Program</A>.) 
<P>
<H4> Action Modifiers
</H4>
<P>
       The following action <i>modifiers</i> are understood:
<PRE>
              actions bind <I>vars</I>
                     $(vars) will be replaced with bound values.
			
              actions existing
                     $(>) includes only source targets currently  existing.

              actions ignore
                     The  return  status of the <I>commands</I> is
                     ignored.

              actions piecemeal
                     <I>commands</I>  are  repeatedly  invoked
                     with a subset of $(>) small enough to fit in
                     the command buffer on this OS.

              actions quietly
                     The action is not  echoed  to  the  standard
                     output.

              actions together
                     The $(>) from multiple invocations of the same
                     action  on  the  same  built target  are   glommed
                     together.

              actions updated
                     $(>) includes only source targets themselves
		     marked for updating.
</PRE>
<H4> Built-in Rules
</H4>
<P>
       Jam/MR has ten built-in rules, none of  which  have  updating
       actions:
<PRE>

              ALWAYS <I>targets</I> ;
                     Rebuilds  <I>targets</I>, even if they are up-to-date.

              DEPENDS <I>targets1</I> : <I>targets2</I> ;
                     Makes <I>targets1</I> dependencies of <I>targets2</I>.

              ECHO <i>args</I> ;
                     Blurts out the message <i>args</I> to stdout.

              EXIT <i>args</I> ;
                     Blurts out the message <i>args</I> to stdout  and
                     then exits with a failure status.

              INCLUDES <I>targets1</I> : <I>targets2</I> ;
                     Makes  <I>targets2</I> dependencies of anything of which 
		     <I>targets1</I> are dependencies.

              LEAVES <I>targets</I> ;
                     Makes each of <I>targets</I> depend only  on  its leaf  
		     sources,  and  not on any intermediate targets. Its leaf 
		     sources are those  source targets without any 
		     dependencies themselves.

              NOCARE <I>targets</I> ;
                     Marks <I>targets</I> as possibly being not needed. If a 
		     <I>target</I> is present, its timestamp is used to compute 
		     dependencies; if it is not present, it is not considered a
		     dependency.

              NOTFILE <I>targets</I> ;
                     Marks <I>targets</I> as pseudotargets, not files.

              NOUPDATE <I>targets</I> ;
                     Causes the timestamps  of  <I>targets</I>  to  be ignored: 
		     either  <I>target</I> exists  or it doesn't. If it  exists,
		     it is  considered eternally old.

              TEMPORARY <I>targets</I> ;
                     Marks <I>targets</I> as temporary; causes <I>targets</I> to be removed 
		     when all their dependencies have been updated.
</PRE>
<P>
       The  ALWAYS, LEAVES, NOCARE, NOTFILE, NOUPDATE, and TEMPORARY affect only the binding phase (q.v.).
<P>
<H3> Flow-of-Control
</H3>
<P>
       Jam/MR has several simple flow-of-control statements:
<PRE>
	      local <i>vars</I> [ = <i>values</i> ] ;

              include <I>file</I> ;

              for <I>var</I> in <I>list</I> { <I>statements</I> }

              switch <I>value</I> 
			{ case <I>pattern1</I> : <I>statements</I> ; 
			  case <I>pattern2</I> : <I>statements</I> ; 
			  ... 
			}

              if  <I>cond</I> 
			{ <I>statements</I> } 
	 	 [ else { <I>statements</I> } ]
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>
       The local statement instantiates new <i>vars</i> inside
       the current {} block. Variables of the same name outside
       of the {} block or before the local statement are unaffected 
       and inaccessible. local may appear anywhere in a block.
       The <i>vars</i> are initialized to <i>values</i>, if present.
       <P>
<LI>
       The include statement causes <b>jam</b> to read
       the named <i>file</i>.   The  file
       is  bound  like  regular targets (see Binding, below), but
       unlike regular targets the include file cannot be built.
       <P>
       The include file is inserted into the input stream during
       the parsing phase. The primary
       input file and all the included file(s) are treated as a
       single file; that is, <b>jam</b> infers no scope boundaries
       from included files.
       <P>
<LI>
       The for loop  executes  <i>statements</i>  for  each  element  in
       <i>list</i>, setting the variable <i>var</i> to the element value.
       <P>
<LI>
       The  switch statement executes zero or one of the enclosed
       <i>statements</i>, depending on which, if any, is the first
       case whose <i>pattern</I> matches <i>value</i>. The
       <i>pattern</I>  values are not variable-expanded.  
       The <i>pattern</I>  values may
       include the following wildcards:
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
              ?         
<TD>		match any single character
<TR><TD>
              *         
<TD>		match zero or more characters
<TR><TD>
              [<i>chars</i>] 
<TD>		match any single character in <i>chars</i>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>
       The if statement does the  obvious;  the  else  clause  is
       optional.  <i>cond</i> is built of:
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE> 
<TR><TD>

<P>
</UL>
<H3> Variables
</H3>
<P>
       Jam/MR variables are lists of zero or more elements, 
       with each element being a string value.
       An undefined variable is indistinguishable from  a
       variable  with an empty list, however, a defined
       variable may have one more elements which are null strings.
       <P>
       Variables are
       either global or target-specific.  All variables are  referenced as $(VARIABLE).
<P>
       A variable is defined with:
<PRE>
              <I>variable</I> = <I>elements</I> ;

              <I>variable</I> += <I>elements</I> ;

              <I>variable</I> on <I>targets</I> = <I>elements</I> ;

              <I>variable</I> on <I>targets</I> += <I>elements</I> ;

              <I>variable</I> default = <I>elements</I> ;
              <I>variable</I>        ?= <I>elements</I> ;
</PRE>
<P>
       The  first  two  forms set <I>variable</I> globally.  The third
       and forth forms  set  a  target-specific  variable,  where
       <I>variable</I>  takes  on  a value only during the binding and
       updating <I>targets</I>.  The = operator replaces any  previous
       elements  of  <I>variable</I>  with  <I>elements</I>;  the  +=  operation
       adds <I>elements</I> to <I>variable</I>'s list of elements.   
       The  final  two forms do the same thing,
       set  <I>variable</I>  globally,  but only if it was previously
       unset.
<P>
       On program start-up, <b>jam</b> imports environment  variable
       settings  into  Jam/MR  variables.  Environment variables are
       split at blanks with each word becoming an element in the
       variable's  list of values.  Environment variables whose names
       end in PATH are split at $(SPLITPATH) characters (e.g., ":" for
       Unix).  Environment  variable values can be overridden on the command line with the
       -s flag.  
       Jam/MR variables are not re-exported to  the  shell
       that  executes  the  updating  actions,  but  the updating
       actions can reference Jam/MR variables with $(<I>variable</I>).
       <P>
       Variables referenced in updating commands will be replaced
       with their values; target-specific values take precedence over global
       values. Variables passed as arguments to actions
       are replaced with their bound values; the "bind" modifier can be used
       on actions to cause other variables to be replaced with bound
       values.
<P>
<H4> Variable Expansion
</H4>
<P>
       During parsing, Jam/MR performs variable expansion  on  each  
       token  that is not a keyword or rule name.
       Such tokens with embedded variable references are replaced
       with  zero or more tokens.  Variable references are of the
       form $(<I>v</I>) or $(<I>vm</I>), where <i>v</i> is the variable  
       name,  and  <I>m</I> are optional modifiers.
<P>
       Variable expansion in a rule's actions is similar to 
       variable expansion  in  statements,  except  that  the  action
       string is tokenized at whitespace regardless of quoting.
<P>
       The  result  of  a  token  after variable expansion is the
       product of the components of the token, where each  component is a literal substring or a list substituting a variable reference.  For example:
<PRE>
              $(X)      -> a b c
              t$(X)     -> ta tb tc
              $(X)z     -> az bz cz
              $(X)-$(X) -> a-a a-b a-c b-a b-b b-c c-a c-b c-c
</PRE>
<P>
       The variable name and modifiers can themselves  contain  a
       variable  reference,  and  this partakes of the product as
       well:
<PRE>
              $(X)      -> a b c
              $(Y)      -> 1 2
              $(Z)      -> X Y
              $($(Z))   -> a b c 1 2
</PRE>
<P>
       Because of this product expansion, 
       if any variable  reference  in a token is undefined, 
       the result of the expansion is an empty list.
       If any variable element is a null string,
       the result propagates the non-null elements: 

<PRE>
              $(X)        -> a ""
              $(Y)        -> "" 1
	      $(Z)	  -> 
	      *$(X)$(Y)*  -> *a* *a1* ** *1*
	      *$(X)$(Z)*  ->
</PRE>

<P>
       A variable element's string value can be parsed into
       grist and filename-related components.
       Modifiers to a variable are used to select elements,
       select components, and replace components. The modifiers
       are:
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
       [<I>n</I>]     
       <TD>Select element number <I>n</I> (starting at 1).  If
              the variable contains fewer than <I>n</I> elements,  the
              result is a zero-element list.
<TR><TD>
       [<I>n</I>-<I>m</I>]   
       <TD>Select elements number <I>n</I> through <I>m</I>.

       <TD>Select elements number <I>n</I> through the last.
<TR><TD>
       :B

<TR><TD>
       :A=<I>archive</I>
             
	     <TD>Replace the archive name with <I>archive</I> (i.e., if LIBS = alpha.lib libbeta.a then $(LIBS:A=gamma) = gamma.lib libgamma.a).

<H3> Built-in Rules and Variables
</H3>
       This section discusses Jam/MR's built-in rules and variables.
       These built-in rules, along with  the
       other  Jam/MR  syntax for manipulating variables, provide the
       foundation upon which the Jambase is built.  A Jamfile, or
       (more  likely)  a  Jamrules  (q.v.), can make use of these
       built-in rules and variables as well.
<P>
<H4> DEPENDS, INCLUDES Rules
</H4>

       Two rules build  the  dependency  graph.   DEPENDS  simply
       makes  its  sources dependencies of its targets.  INCLUDES
       makes its sources dependencies of anything  of  which  its
       targets  are dependencies.  This reflects the dependencies
       that arise when one  source  file  includes  another:  the
       object  built  from  the  source  file depends both on the
       original and included source file,  but  the  two  sources
       files don't depend on each other.  For example:
<PRE>
              DEPENDS foo.o : foo.c ;
              INCLUDES foo.c : foo.h ;
</PRE>
       Both "foo.c" and "foo.h" become dependencies of "foo.o" in
       this example.
<P>
<H4> ALWAYS, LEAVES, NOCARE, NOTFILE, NOUPDATE, TEMPORARY Rules
</H4>
       Six rules mark targets so that <b>jam</b> treats them differently
       during  its  target binding and updating phase.  Normally,
       <b>jam</b> updates a target if it is missing, if  its  filesystem
       modification  time  is  older than any of its dependencies
       (recursively), or if any of  its  dependencies  are  being
       updated.   This  basic behavior can be changed by invoking
       the following rules with the target  name  as  the  rule's
       target:
<P>
       The  ALWAYS  rule causes its targets to be always updated.
       This is used for the clean and uninstall targets, as  they
       have  no  dependencies and would otherwise appear never to
       need building.  It is best applied  to  targets  that  are
       also  NOTFILE  targets, but it can also be used to force a
       real file to be updated as well.
<P>
       The NOCARE rule causes <b>jam</b> to ignore its targets  if  they
       can't  be  found  and have no updating actions.  Normally,
       <b>jam</b> issues a warning about a target that  can't  be  built
       and  then  refuses  to build anything that depends on that
       target.  The HdrRule in Jambase uses NOCARE on the header file  names
       found  during  header  file scanning, to let <b>jam</b> know that
       the included files may  not  exist.   For  example,  if  a
       #include  is  within  an #ifdef, the included file may not
       actually be around.
<P>
       The NOTFILE rule marks its targets as  being  pseudotargets,  
       that  is,  targets  that  aren't really files.  The
       actions on such a target are only executed if the target's
       dependencies  are updated, or if the target is also marked
       with ALWAYS.  The default <b>jam</b> target "all" is a 
       pseudotarget. In Jambase, NOTFILE is used to define 
       several addition convenient pseudotargets.
<P>
       The  NOUPDATE  rule  causes <b>jam</b> to ignore the modification
       time of the target.  This has two  effects:   first,  once
       the target has been created it will never be updated; second, 
       manually updating target will not cause other targets
       to be updated.  In Jambase, for example, this rule is applied 
       to directories by the
       MkDir rule, because  MkDir  only  cares  that  the  target
       directory exists, not when it has last been updated.
<P>
       The  TEMPORARY rule allows for targets to be deleted after
       they are generated.  If <b>jam</b> sees that a  temporary  target
       is  missing,  it  will use the target's parent's time when
       determining if the target needs  updating.   Jambase uses
       TEMPORARY to mark object  files
       that are archived in a library after they are built, so
       that they can be deleted after they are archived.
<P>
       The LEAVES rule makes each of the targets depend  only  on
       its  "leaf"  dependencies.   This  makes  it immune to its
       dependencies being updated, as the "leaf" dependencies are
       those  without their own dependencies and without updating
       actions.  This allows a target to be updated only if original 
       source files change.
<P>
<H4> ECHO, EXIT Rules
</H4>
       These  two  rules are are used only in <b>jam</b>'s parsing phase.
       The ECHO rule just echoes its targets to the standard output.   
       The EXIT rule does the same and then does a brutal,
       fatal exit of <b>jam</b>.
<P>
<H4> SEARCH, LOCATE Variables
</H4>
       These two variables control the binding of target names to
       real  files:  they  indicate  what  path  name  is  to  be
       prepended to the target name when substituting values for
       variables referenced in action definitions.
       (See "Binding" in
       <a href="Jam.html">The Jam/MR Executable Program</A>.)
       <P>

       $(SEARCH)  provides  a list of directories along which <b>jam</b>
       scans  looking  for   a   target.    $(LOCATE)   overrides
       $(SEARCH),  indicating the directory where the target must
       be.  Normally, $(SEARCH) is set for existing targets while
       $(LOCATE) is set for the targets which <b>jam</b> must build.  
       Only the first element in $(LOCATE) is used for binding.
       If neither $(SEARCH) nor $(LOCATE) are set, or if the name of
       the  target  is a rooted file name (e.g., on UNIX beginning
       with "/"), then the file name is assumed to be the  target
       name.
<P>
       Both $(SEARCH) and $(LOCATE) should be set target-specific
       and not globally.  If they were set  globally,  <b>jam</b>  would
       use  the same paths for all file binding, which is  
       not likely to produce  sane  results.
       When writing your own rules,  especially  ones  not  built
       upon  those  in  Jambase, you may need to set $(SEARCH) or
       $(LOCATE) directly. 
       Almost all of the rules defined in Jambase
       set $(SEARCH) and $(LOCATE) to  sensible  values
       for  sources they are looking for and targets they create,
       respectively. 
<P>
<P>
<H4> HDRSCAN, HDRRULE Variables
</H4>
       These two variable  control  header  file  scanning.   The
       first  is  an  egrep(1) pattern, with ()'s surrounding the
       file name, used  to  find  file  inclusion  statements  in
       source  files.  The second is the name of a rule to invoke
       with the results of the scan: the scanned file is the target,  
       the  found  files are the sources.  This is the only
       place where <b>jam</b> invokes a rule through a variable setting.
<P>
       Both $(HDRSCAN) and $(HDRRULE) must be set for header file
       scanning to take place, and they should be set target-specific  
       and  not  globally.  If they were set globally, all
       files,  including  executables  and  libraries,  would  be
       scanned for header file include statements.
<P>
       The  scanning for header file inclusions is not exact, but
       it is at least dynamic, so there is no need to  run
       something  like  makedepend(GNU) to create a static dependency 
       file. The scanning mechanism errs on the side of robustness 
       (i.e., it is more likely to return filenames that are not actually
       used by the compiler than to miss include files) 
       because it can't tell if #include lines are inside #ifdefs or
       other conditional logic. 
       In Jambase, HdrRule  applies the NOCARE rule to each header file 
       found during scanning so that if the file isn't present and isn't
       needed during compilation, <b>jam</b> doesn't skip its dependencies.
       <P>
       Also, scanning for regular expressions only  works
       where  the  included  file name is literally in the source
       file.  It can't handle languages  that  allow  including
       files using variable names (as the Jam/MR language itself does).
<P>
<H4> Platform Identifier Variables
</H4>
<P>
	A number of Jam/MR built-in variables can be used to 
	identify runtime platform:
	<CENTER>
	<TABLE>
	<TR><TD>UNIX<TD>true on Unix platforms
	<TR><TD>NT<TD>true on NT platforms
	<TR><TD>VMS<TD>true on VMS platforms
	<TR><TD>MAC<TD>true on MAC platforms
	<TR><TD>OS2<TD>true on OS2 platforms
	<TR><TD>OS<TD>OS identifier string 
	<TR><TD>OSVER<TD>OS version, when applicable
	<TR><TD>OSPLAT<TD>Underlying architecture, when applicable
	<TR><TD>JAMVERSION<TD><b>jam</b> version, currently "2.2"
	</TABLE>
	</CENTER>
<P>
<H4> JAMDATE Variable
</H4>
	Initialized to time and date at <b>jam</b> startup.

<P>
<H4> JAMSHELL Variable
</H4>
       When  <b>jam</b>  executes  a  rule's  action block, it forks and
       execs a shell, passing the action block as an argument  to
       the  shell.   The invocation of the shell can be controlled by
       $(JAMSHELL). On Unix, for example:
<PRE>
              JAMSHELL = /bin/sh -c % ;
</PRE>
       The % is replaced with the text of the action block.
<P>
       <b>jam</b> can build targets in parallel, as long as  the
       dependencies  among  files  are  properly  spelled out and
       actions don't create fixed  named  files  in  the  current
       directory.   (If  either  of those two provisions are violated, 
       <B>jam</B> can trip over itself when building in  parallel
       things  which just happen to build OK sequentially.)  When
       building in parallel, <b>jam</b> simply forks off more  than  one
       shell at a time.
<P>
       <b>jam</b>  does not directly support building in parallel across
       multiple hosts, since that is  heavily  dependent  on  the
       local  environment.   To build in parallel across multiple
       hosts, you need to write  your  own  shell  that  provides
       access  to the multiple hosts.  You then reset $(JAMSHELL)
       to reference it.
<P>
       Just as <b>jam</b> expands a % to  be  the  text  of  the  rule's
       action  block, it expands a ! to be the multi-process slot
       number.  The slot number varies between 1 and  the  number
       of  concurrent  jobs permitted by the -j flag given on the
       command line.  Armed with this, it is possible to write  a
   multiple host shell.  For example:
<PRE>
	  #!/bin/sh

	  # This sample JAMSHELL uses the SunOS on(1) command to execute
	  # a command string with an identical environment on another host.
	  #
	  # Set JAMSHELL = jamshell ! %
	  #
	  # where jamshell is the name of this shell file.
	  #
	  # This version handles up to -j6; after that they get executed
	  # locally.

	  case $1 in
	  1|4) on winken sh -c "$2";;
	  2|5) on blinken sh -c "$2";;
	  3|6) on nod sh -c "$2";;
	  *)   eval "$2";;
	  esac
