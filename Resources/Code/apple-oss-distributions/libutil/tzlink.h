/*!
 * @function tzlink
 * Create the timezone link at TZDEFAULT
 *
 * @param tz
 * New timezone, e.g. "America/Los_Angeles". This path is relative to TZDIR,
 * and must not contain any relative path components or stray slashes.
 * The file must exist and must be a valid timezone file with correct
 * ownership (root:wheel) and permissions (0644).
 *
 * @result
 * If the call succeeds, will return zero. Otherwise, returns an error:
 *   EINVAL: Invalid input, e.g. NULL or a path with relative components.
 *   ENAMETOOLONG: Input too long (generates a path > PATH_MAX)
 *   ENOENT: Specified file doesn't exist or fails owner/perm check.
 *   EPERM: Entitlement check failed.
 *   EIO: Failed to communicate with backing daemon.
 *   ENOTSUP: Always returned on OS X.
 * And possibly others not documented here.
 *
 * @discussion
 * This call can be used by any sufficiently-entitled client to overwrite
 * the timezone link at TZDEFAULT (see <tzfile.h>). It communicates with a
 * root daemon that does the necessary validation and file system work.
 * Upon success, the "SignificantTimeChangeNotification" notification is
 * posted.
