repack.useDeltaBaseOffset::
	By default, linkgit:git-repack[1] creates packs that use
	delta-base offset. If you need to share your repository with
	Git older than version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb
	protocol such as http, then you need to set this option to
	"false" and repack. Access from old Git versions over the
	native protocol are unaffected by this option.

repack.packKeptObjects::
	If set to true, makes `git repack` act as if
	`--pack-kept-objects` was passed. See linkgit:git-repack[1] for
	details. Defaults to `false` normally, but `true` if a bitmap
	index is being written (either via `--write-bitmap-index` or
	`repack.writeBitmaps`).

repack.useDeltaIslands::
	If set to true, makes `git repack` act as if `--delta-islands`
	was passed. Defaults to `false`.

repack.writeBitmaps::
	When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all
	objects to disk (e.g., when `git repack -a` is run).  This
	index can speed up the "counting objects" phase of subsequent
	packs created for clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk
	space and extra time spent on the initial repack.  This has
	no effect if multiple packfiles are created.
	Defaults to true on bare repos, false otherwise.
