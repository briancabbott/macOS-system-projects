	Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the
	'web' format. See linkgit:git-help[1].

help.format::
	Override the default help format used by linkgit:git-help[1].
	Values 'man', 'info', 'web' and 'html' are supported. 'man' is
	the default. 'web' and 'html' are the same.

help.autoCorrect::
	Automatically correct and execute mistyped commands after
	waiting for the given number of deciseconds (0.1 sec). If more
	than one command can be deduced from the entered text, nothing
	will be executed.  If the value of this option is negative,
	the corrected command will be executed immediately. If the
	value is 0 - the command will be just shown but not executed.
	This is the default.

help.htmlPath::
	Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File system paths
	and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be prefixed with this path when
	help is displayed in the 'web' format. This defaults to the documentation
	path of your Git installation.
