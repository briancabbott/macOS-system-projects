stash.useBuiltin::
       Set to `false` to use the legacy shell script implementation of
       linkgit:git-stash[1]. Is `true` by default, which means use
       the built-in rewrite of it in C.
+
The C rewrite is first included with Git version 2.22 (and Git for Windows
version 2.19). This option serves as an escape hatch to re-enable the
legacy version in case any bugs are found in the rewrite. This option and
the shell script version of linkgit:git-stash[1] will be removed in some
future release.
+
If you find some reason to set this option to `false`, other than
one-off testing, you should report the behavior difference as a bug in
Git (see https://git-scm.com/community for details).

stash.showPatch::
	If this is set to true, the `git stash show` command without an
	option will show the stash entry in patch form.  Defaults to false.
	See description of 'show' command in linkgit:git-stash[1].

stash.showStat::
	If this is set to true, the `git stash show` command without an
	option will show diffstat of the stash entry.  Defaults to true.
	See description of 'show' command in linkgit:git-stash[1].
