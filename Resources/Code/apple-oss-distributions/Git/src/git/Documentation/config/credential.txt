credential.helper::
	Specify an external helper to be called when a username or
	password credential is needed; the helper may consult external
	storage to avoid prompting the user for the credentials. Note
	that multiple helpers may be defined. See linkgit:gitcredentials[7]
	for details.

credential.useHttpPath::
	When acquiring credentials, consider the "path" component of an http
	or https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for more information.

credential.username::
	If no username is set for a network authentication, use this username
	by default. See credential.<context>.* below, and
	linkgit:gitcredentials[7].

credential.<url>.*::
	Any of the credential.* options above can be applied selectively to
	some credentials. For example "credential.https://example.com.username"
	would set the default username only for https connections to
	example.com. See linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for details on how URLs are
	matched.

credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP::
	Tell git-credential-cache--daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of quitting.
