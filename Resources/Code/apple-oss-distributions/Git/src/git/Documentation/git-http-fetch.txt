NAME
----
git-http-fetch - Download from a remote Git repository via HTTP


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git http-fetch' [-c] [-t] [-a] [-d] [-v] [-w filename] [--recover] [--stdin] <commit> <url>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Downloads a remote Git repository via HTTP.

This command always gets all objects. Historically, there were three options
`-a`, `-c` and `-t` for choosing which objects to download. They are now
silently ignored.

OPTIONS
-------
commit-id::
        Either the hash or the filename under [URL]/refs/ to
        pull.

-a, -c, -t::
	These options are ignored for historical reasons.
-v::
	Report what is downloaded.

-w <filename>::
        Writes the commit-id into the filename under $GIT_DIR/refs/<filename> on
        the local end after the transfer is complete.

--stdin::
	Instead of a commit id on the command line (which is not expected in this
	case), 'git http-fetch' expects lines on stdin in the format

		<commit-id>['\t'<filename-as-in--w>]

--recover::
	Verify that everything reachable from target is fetched.  Used after
	an earlier fetch is interrupted.
