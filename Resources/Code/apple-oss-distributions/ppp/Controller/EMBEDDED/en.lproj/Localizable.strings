    PPP error strings
    
    PPP will display one of the following LastCause published in the service/state
    of the PPP dictionnary.
    PPP errors contain a PPP generic part in the key "LastCause".
    and a Device specific part in the key "DeviceLastCause".
    
    The Device specific part is there to give more details of the PPP error.
    For example, for a PPP Error 8, meaning that the connection has failed, 
    we can have a Device Error detailing the failure cause, like Busy, NoDialTone...
    
    Therefore, if the device specific part is not 0, 
    PPP will display the device error message, that is defained in the bundle of the 
    corresponding PPP subtype (for example PPPSerial.ppp).
    If the Device specific part is 0, then PPP will display the PPP message.
    Device error must be formatted "Device Error %d".
    
    Device errors start from 1. PPP Error start from 0.
    If the text for the error does not exist, the error number will be displayed.
    If the text for the error exist but is empty, nothing will be displayed 
	PPP Error 5 is normal exit error and is special case in the code.
