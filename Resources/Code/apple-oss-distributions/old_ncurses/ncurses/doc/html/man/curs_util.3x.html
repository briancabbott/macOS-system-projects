       <STRONG>int</STRONG> <STRONG>flushinp(void);</STRONG>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG> macro expands to a character string which is a
       printable representation  of  the  character  <EM>c</EM>.   Control
       characters  are  displayed  in  the <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM> notation.  Printing
       characters are displayed as is.

       The <STRONG>keyname</STRONG> routine returns a character string correspond-
       ing to the key <EM>c</EM>.

       The <STRONG>filter</STRONG> routine, if used, must be called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>
       or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> are called.  The effect is that,  during  those
       calls,  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  is  set  to 1; the capabilities <STRONG>clear</STRONG>, <STRONG>cup</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>cud</STRONG>, <STRONG>cud1</STRONG>, <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>, <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>,  <STRONG>vpa</STRONG>  are  disabled;  and  the  <STRONG>home</STRONG>
       string is set to the value of <STRONG>cr</STRONG>.

       The  <STRONG>use_env</STRONG> routine, if used, is called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> are called.  When called with <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>  as  an  argu-
       ment,  the  values  of  <STRONG>lines</STRONG> and <STRONG>columns</STRONG> specified in the
       <EM>terminfo</EM> database will be used, even if environment  vari-
       ables  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG>  and <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> (used by default) are set, or if
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG> is running in  a  window  (in  which  case  default
       behavior  would  be  to  use  the window size if <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> are not set).

       The <STRONG>putwin</STRONG> routine writes all data associated with  window
       <EM>win</EM> into the file to which <EM>filep</EM> points.  This information
       can be later retrieved using the <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> function.

       The <STRONG>getwin</STRONG> routine reads window related data stored in the
       file  by <STRONG>putwin</STRONG>.  The routine then creates and initializes
       a new window using that data.  It returns a pointer to the
       new window.

       The  <STRONG>delay_output</STRONG>  routine inserts an <EM>ms</EM> millisecond pause
       in output.  This routine should not  be  used  extensively
       because  padding  characters  are  used  rather than a CPU
       pause.
       The <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG> routine throws away any  typeahead  that  has
       been  typed  by  the user and has not yet been read by the
       program.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Except for  <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG>,  routines  that  return  an  integer
       return  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  upon  failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 specifies only "an
       integer value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.

       <STRONG>flushinp</STRONG> always returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue 4 describes these func-
       tions.

       The SVr4 documentation describes the action of <STRONG>filter</STRONG> only
       in  the  vaguest  terms.   The description here is adapted
       from the XSI Curses standard (which erroneously  fails  to
       describe the disabling of <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>).


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that  <STRONG>unctrl</STRONG>  is  a macro, which is defined in &lt;<STRONG>unc-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>trl.h</STRONG>&gt;.
