<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  functions provide an interface to mouse events from
       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Mouse events are  represented  by  <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>
       pseudo-key values in the <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> input stream.

       To  make mouse events visible, use the <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG> function.
       This will  set  the  mouse  events  to  be  reported.   By
       default,  no mouse events are reported.  The function will
       return a mask to indicate which  of  the  specified  mouse
       events  can be reported; on complete failure it returns 0.
       If oldmask is non-NULL, this function fills the  indicated
       location  with  the  previous  value of the given window's
       mouse event mask.

       As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask  may  turn  off
       the  mouse pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.
       Whether this happens is device-dependent.

       Here are the mouse event type masks:

       <EM>Name</EM>                     <EM>Description</EM>
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       BUTTON1_PRESSED          mouse button 1 down
       BUTTON1_RELEASED         mouse button 1 up
       BUTTON1_CLICKED          mouse button 1 clicked
       BUTTON1_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse button 1 double clicked
       BUTTON1_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse button 1 triple clicked

       BUTTON2_PRESSED          mouse button 2 down
       BUTTON2_RELEASED         mouse button 2 up
       BUTTON2_CLICKED          mouse button 2 clicked
       BUTTON2_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse button 2 double clicked
       BUTTON2_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse button 2 triple clicked
       BUTTON3_PRESSED          mouse button 3 down
       BUTTON3_RELEASED         mouse button 3 up
       BUTTON3_CLICKED          mouse button 3 clicked
       BUTTON3_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse button 3 double clicked
       BUTTON3_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse button 3 triple clicked
       BUTTON4_PRESSED          mouse button 4 down
       BUTTON4_RELEASED         mouse button 4 up
       BUTTON4_CLICKED          mouse button 4 clicked
       BUTTON4_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse button 4 double clicked
       BUTTON4_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse button 4 triple clicked
       BUTTON_SHIFT             shift was down during button state change
       BUTTON_CTRL              control was down during button state change
       BUTTON_ALT               alt was down during button state change
       ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS         report all button state changes
       REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION    report mouse movement

       Once a class of mouse events have been made visible  in  a
       window,  calling  the  <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>  function on that window may
       return <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG> as an indicator that a  mouse  event  has
       been queued.  To read the event data and pop the event off
       the queue, call <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>.  This function will return <STRONG>OK</STRONG> if
       a mouse event is actually visible in the given window, <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>
       otherwise.  When <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG>, the  data  deposited
       as  y  and  x  in  the event structure coordinates will be
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates.  The  returned
       state  mask  will have exactly one bit set to indicate the
       event type.

       The <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG> function behaves  analogously  to  <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG>.
       It  pushes  a  <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>  event  onto the input queue, and
       associates with  that  event  the  given  state  data  and
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates.

       The  <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  function  tests  whether  a  given  pair of
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates is enclosed  by
       a  given  window, returning TRUE if it is and FALSE other-
       wise.  It is useful for determining  what  subset  of  the
       screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

       The <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG> function transforms a given pair of coor-
       dinates from stdscr-relative coordinates  to  screen-rela-
       tive  coordinates  or  vice  versa.  Please remember, that
       stdscr-relative coordinates are not  always  identical  to
       screen-relative   coordinates  due  to  the  mechanism  to
       reserve lines on top or bottom of  the  screen  for  other
       purposes (ripoff() call, see also slk_...  functions).  If
       the parameter <STRONG>to_screen</STRONG> is <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>, the pointers <STRONG>pY,</STRONG> <STRONG>pX</STRONG>  must
       reference  the coordinates of a location inside the window
       <STRONG>win</STRONG>.  They are converted  to  screen-relative  coordinates
       and  returned through the pointers.  If the conversion was
       successful, the function returns  <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>.   If  one  of  the
       parameters was NULL or the location is not inside the win-
       dow, <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned.  If <STRONG>to_screen</STRONG> is <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>, the point-
       ers  <STRONG>pY,</STRONG>  <STRONG>pX</STRONG>  must  reference screen-relative coordinates.
       They are converted to stdscr-relative coordinates  if  the
       window <STRONG>win</STRONG> encloses this point.  In this case the function
       returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>.  If one of the parameters  is  NULL  or  the
       point is not inside the window, <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> is returned.  Please
       notice, that the referenced coordinates are only  replaced
       by  the  converted  coordinates  if the transformation was
       successful.

       The <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG> function sets the maximum time (in thou-
       sands  of  a  second)  that  can  elapse between press and
       release events for them to be recognized as a click.   Use
       <STRONG>mouseinterval(-1)</STRONG> to disable click resolution.  This func-
       tion returns the previous interval value.  The default  is
       one sixth of a second.

       Note  that  mouse  events will be ignored when input is in
       cooked mode, and will cause an error beep when cooked mode
       is  being simulated in a window by a function such as <STRONG>get-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>str</STRONG> that expects a linefeed for input-loop termination.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>, <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG> and <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG> return the  integer
       <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure or <STRONG>OK</STRONG> upon successful completion.  <STRONG>mouse-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>mask</STRONG> returns the mask of reportable events.  <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>wmouse_trafo</STRONG> are boolean functions returning <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> or <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>
       depending on their test result.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These calls were designed for  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>,  and  are  not
       found in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous
       version of curses.

       The feature macro <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG> is provided so the
       preprocessor  can  be  used to test whether these features
       are present  (its  value  is  1).   If  the  interface  is
       changed, the value of <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG> will be incre-
       mented.

       The order of the <STRONG>MEVENT</STRONG> structure members is  not  guaran-
       teed.   Additional fields may be added to the structure in
       the future.

       Under  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>,  these  calls  are  implemented  using
       either  xterm's  built-in mouse-tracking API or Alessandro
       Rubini's gpm server.  If you  are  using  something  other
       than  xterm  and  there  is  no gpm daemon running on your
       machine, mouse events will not be visible  to  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG>
       (and the <STRONG>wmousemask</STRONG> function will always return <STRONG>0</STRONG>).
       The z member in the event structure is not presently used.
       It is intended for use with touch screens  (which  may  be
       pressure-sensitive)   or   with   3D-mice/trackballs/power
       gloves.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Mouse events under xterm will not in fact be ignored  dur-
       ing  cooked mode, if they have been enabled by <STRONG>wmousemask</STRONG>.
       Instead, the xterm mouse report sequence  will  appear  in
       the string read.

       Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in
       a window with its keypad bit off, since  they  are  inter-
       preted  as  a  variety  of  function  key.   Your terminfo
       description must have <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> set to "\E[M"  (the  beginning
       of the response from xterm for mouse clicks).

       Because  there  are  no  standard  terminal responses that
       would serve to identify terminals which support the  xterm
       mouse  protocol,  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> assumes that if your $TERM envi-
       ronment variable contains "xterm", or <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> is defined  in
       the terminal description, then the terminal may send mouse
       events.
