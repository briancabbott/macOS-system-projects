DCOM:


We (well, me mainly) are beginning to support DCOM/Object RPC as documented by Microsoft.

The aim is to produce a free implementation of DCOM that can be installed by
anyone on anyone's Linux box without a heavy license fee.  People can then
really think about using it for their applications and then we might find a
whole host of component-orientated applications start to spring up, and then
we might find a lot of components being created to make the applications
easier to develop, and the range of applications will grow and grow...
