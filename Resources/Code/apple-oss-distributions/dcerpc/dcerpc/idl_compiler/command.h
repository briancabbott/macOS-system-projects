/*
 *  IDL compiler command line options are kept in two parallel arrays,
 *  cmd_opt and cmd_val.  These arrays are passed as arguments to any
 *  routines that need to access command line information.  The partial
 *  signature of such routines is:
 *
 *  rtn
 *  (
 *      boolean     *cmd_opt,        * [in] Array of command option flags *
 *      void        **cmd_val,       * [in] Array of command option values *
 *      ...
 *  )
 *
 *  cmd_opt is an array of booleans.  Each entry is set to "true" if the
 *  corresponding option is selected and set to "false" if it is not.
 *  Some options, when set to "true", contain additional information in
 *  the cmd_val array.
 *
 *  cmd_val is an array of (void *) elements.  If an element in the cmd_opt
 *  array is set to "false", the corresponding element in the cmd_val array
 *  will be equal to NULL.  If an element in the cmd_opt array is set to
 *  "true", the corresponding element in the cmd_val array will in general
 *  contain additional information for that option.  The obvious exceptions
 *  to this rule are any "True/False" options, for which no additional
 *  information is necessary.
 *
 *  Valid elements of the cmd_val array point to additional data for
 *  the corresponding option.  The additional data can be of a simple type
 *  or a constructed type, depending on the information needed to describe
 *  the option.  For most is it simply (char *), a pointer to a string.
 *
 *  The list of #define's below define a set of indices into the two arrays.
 *  The meaning of each option should be obvious from its index name, which
 *  closely resembles the corresponding command option.
 *
 *  Comments appear next to those options for which there is additional
 *  information in the cmd_val array.  The comment indicates the actual
 *  data type of the cmd_val array element for that option, and what it
 *  represents.
 *
 *  *NOTE*: When adding new options to the list below, be sure to also modify
 *          the opt_info array for the dump_cmd_data function (command.c).
