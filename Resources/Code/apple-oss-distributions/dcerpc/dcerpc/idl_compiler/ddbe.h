/*
    The relationship between DDBE_vectors_t data and the routines in ddbe.c that
    manipulate them is intricate; here is an attempt at a complete definition.

    1) The definition vector holds descriptions for all types that are
    referenced indirectly by the interpreter.  These are NOT limited to irep
    IR_op_type_indirect_k tuples; for example in some cases the interpreter
    needs to references arrays or pointers indirectly, but the irep flattens
    each instance rather than producing an IR_op_type_indirect_k tuple.

    2) The type vector holds descriptions for parameter types.  These descrip-
    tions can have indirect references into the definition vector.  Note that
    indirect references are always into the definition vector.

    3) At a higher level the distinction between type and definition vectors is
    not necessary; at this level it is useful (if not necessary) in order to
    keep track of indirections.  The terminology can get confusing - an attempt
    has been made to use the terms "type", "definition", or "type/definition"
    in the proper context, but there might be ambiguities about.  For example,
    the DDBE_type_i_t "type vector" fields really are "definition vector"
    fields in this context; the confusing naming is because at a higher level,
    the type and definition vectors are concatenated and collectively called
    the type vector.

    4) The type_p field always points into the type vector list.  The type
    vector can be created sequentially since indirect references are put into
    the definition vector.  Thus, the type_p always points to the last entry in
    the type vector list.

    5) The defn_p field always points into the definition vector list.  The
    definition vector can NOT be created sequentially since an indirect
    reference requires adding entries to the list and then reverting the
    insertion cursor back to the indirection reference.  Thus, the defn_p does
    NOT always point to the last entry in the definition vector list.

    6) The p_cur_p field always points at either the type_p or defn_p fields.
    When processing, some entries always go into the definition vector, some
    always go into the type vector, and some always go into either one -
    whichever is current.  Indirecting through p_cur_p handles the latter case
    easily.  Entries that do not fall into one of these 3 categories go into
    the parent vector - see 9).

    7) Insertions into the vector lists are always AFTER the indicated element
    and leave the vector list pointer pointing at the new element.

    8) Whenever the beginning of a constructed type is encountered, the type
    kind is pushed onto a data scoping stack (provided transparently by the
    IREP scoping services).  One common use of the stack is that many actions
    differ if the parent type is of a certain kind.

    9) When the need for an indirect type definition in the definition vector
    occurs, the current (type or definition) vector pointer is pushed onto an
    indirection scoping stack (ind_sp field).  This stack is independent of the
    data scoping stack.  The current vector becomes the definition vector.

     a) During processing of the indirect type, entries can be made into the
        parent vector by referencing the top value on the indirection stack.
        Note that if both parent and child are in the definition vector, there
        are two cursors into the definition vector concurrently.  Special care
        must be taken when both cursors start at the same entry.  In this case,
        make sure that the first entry is to the child, not the parent.  This
        assures that child entries do not get interspersed with the parent
        in the definition vector.

     b) When processing of the indirect type completes, indirection scope is
        popped.  The type vector or definition vector pointer, as determined
        from the indirection stack level, is restored to the saved value on
        the indirection stack.  This vector again becomes current.  If it is
        the definition vector, note that subsequent entries will occur BEFORE
        any child entries that were made but AFTER any parent entries that
        were added during child processing.

    10) Indirect type definitions that are also indirectly represented in the
    IREP (via an IR_op_type_indirect_k tuple) form a subset of the situation
    described in 9) above.  For these cases, another stack is necessary.  The
    tuple stack is used to save the address of the next tuple after the
    IR_op_type_indirect_k tuple.  Then the tuple pointer is changed to point at
    the indirectly referenced type's tuples.  When processing of the type is
    complete, the tuple pointer is restored from the saved value on the stack.

    11) Indirect type definitions described in 9) above also cause the current
    offset and routine vector pointers to be pushed on the indirection scoping
    stack. This is necessary to properly handle processing of nested definitions
    for which offset and/or routine vector entries are necessary.  When
    processing of the indirect type completes, the offset and routine vector
    pointers are restored from the stack.

    12) Indirect vector entries - where a vector entry refers to another
    location in the same or different vector - are accomplished in two ways.
    The straightforward way is to simply insert a vector entry that contains
    a pointer to the referenced vector entry.  A slightly more complex way is
    needed when the referenced vector entry has not yet been created.  In this
    case, a vector entry is created that points to a cell that will eventually
    contain a pointer to the referenced vector entry.  In either case, a
    subsequent processing pass can sequentially walk the vector and resolve
    the indirections with actual indices.

    13) The remainder of DDBE_vectors_t fields are flags whose purpose should be
    fairly obvious from the code.
