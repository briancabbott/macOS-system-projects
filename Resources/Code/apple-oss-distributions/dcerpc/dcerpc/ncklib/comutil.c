**  DESCRIPTION:
**
**  Copies n characters from one string into another.

**  except that the destination string is *always* null terminated.
**  For this reason care must be taken that the value n is always
**  one less than the available size for the target. Also, this routine
**  doesn't bother to return useless information like strncpy.
**
**  INPUTS:
**
**      dst_string      A pointer to the destination string.
**
**      src_string      A pointer to the source string.
**
**      max_len         The maximum number of characters to be copied
**                      from the source to the destination.
