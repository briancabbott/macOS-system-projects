**
**  ABSTRACT:
**
**  Definition of the Call Services for the Common Communication
**  Services component. These routines are called by the stub to
**  perform the actual communications for an RPC. A call handle
**  is created, and is subsequently used to dispatch to the appropriate
**  communications protocol service.

**  SCOPE:              PUBLIC - declared in rpc.idl
**
**  DESCRIPTION:
**
**  Begin a Remote Procedure Call. This is the first in a sequence of calls
**  by the client stub. It returns the information needed to marshal input
**  arguments. This routine is intended for use by the client stub only.
**
**  INPUTS:
**
**      binding_h       The binding handle which identifies the protocol
**                      stack to which the RPC is being made.
**
**      flags           The options to be applied to this RPC. One of these
**                      options must be set. They may not be ORed together.

**                      rpc_c_call_brdcst
**
**      ifspec_h        The interface specification handle containing the
**                      interface UUID and version in which the RPC is
**                      contained. Also contains client stub supported
**                      transfer syntaxes.
**
**      opnum           The operation number in the interface the RPC
**                      corresponds to.
**
**  INPUTS/OUTPUTS:     none
**
**  OUTPUTS:
**
**      xfer_syntax     The negotiated transfer syntax. The stub will use
**                      this to marshal the input arguments and unmarshal
**                      the output arguments of the RPC.
**
**      status          A value indicating the status of the routine.
**
**          rpc_s_ok        The call was successful.
**          rpc_s_invalid_binding
**                          RPC Protocol ID in binding handle was invalid.
