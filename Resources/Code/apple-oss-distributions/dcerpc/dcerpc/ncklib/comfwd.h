**
**  FACILITY:

**
**  ABSTRACT:
**
**  Private interface to the Common Communications Forwarding Service for use
**  by RPC Protocol Services and Local Location Broker.  This service is
**  in its own file (rather then com.h) so that the llb does not have to
**  include other runtime internal include files.

/*
 * The beginning of this file specifies the "public" (visible to the llbd)
 * portion of the fwd interface.
 */

/*
 * The signature of a server forwarding map function.
 *
 * The function determines an appropriate forwarding address for the
 * packet based on the provided info.  The "fwd_action" output parameter
 * determines the disposition of the packet; "drop" means just drop the
 * packet (don't forward, don't send anything back to the client), "reject"
 * means send a rejection back to the client (and drop the packet), and
 * "forward" means that the packet should be forwarded to the address
 * specified in the "fwd_addr" output parameter.
 *
 * WARNING:  This should be a relatively light weight, non-blocking
 * function as the runtime may (will likely) be calling the function
 * from the context of the runtime's listener thread (i.e. handling
 * of additional incoming received packets is suspended while this
 * provided function is executing).
