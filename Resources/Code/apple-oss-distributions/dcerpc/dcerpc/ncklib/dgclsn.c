     * Fault packet considerations:
     * If the fault is to a previous call it may be a duplicate, however,
     * it may also be a valid fault packet that has not been "ack"ed.
     * Valid fault packets may result from activity ID's being rapidly
     * reused after an "ack" has been lost.  Also, the packet may be
     * for this call and we may already be in an error state which may
     * have been because we've already received a fault but for some
     * reason we haven't completed the call yet.  The proper action in
     * all three of the above cases is to send an "ack" to stop the server
     * from resending the fault.  Any extra "ack"s will be ignored by
     * the server.  Note that the seq number can actually be greater
     * than the current call's sequence due to proxy calls.
