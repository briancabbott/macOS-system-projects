/*
 * Datagram Packet Rationing
 *
 * Every active call requires a packet pool "reservation".  The purpose
 * of this reservation is to guarantee that the call can always make
 * progress.
 *
 * "Progress" is defined as the ability to exchange at least one packet
 * at a time over a conversation.
 *
 * "Rationing" is the condition where calls are only allowed to use
 * their reserved packet.
 *
 * The condition that invokes rationing is: the number of available
 * packets in the free pool is less than or equal to the number of
 * packet reservations.
 */

/*
 * Define the maximum number of packet's (used for both xqe's and rqe's)
 * that we'll ever allocate.

/*
 * One of the conditions on which the packet rationing scheme is based is
 * that, when rationing is necessary, all RPC threads will be able to drain
 * their queues and use only the packets they have reserved.  One possible
 * scenario is which this wouldn't be the case is if in a group of N
 * inter-communicating processes (where N can be 1, in the case of KRPC)
 * all packets got queued up by clients before the rationing state was
 * entered.  In such a case, there would be no reservations to grant to
 * the server sides of the calls, and thus no way for the clients to drain.
 *
 * Avoiding this potential deadlock requires that we guarantee that at least
 * one server call can be started for such a group of N processes.  Since N can
 * be 1, it follows that every process must be guaranteed that it can always
 * start at least one server call.
 *
 * We guarantee the capability of running server calls by setting aside
 * reservations for that purpose at startup.  A single reservation would be
 * sufficient to guarantee the correctness of the algorithm, but making a few
 * reservations will increase the fairness in the worst of cases.
