 * Call wait flags.
 *
 * This enumeration defines the types of events that calls need to wait
 * for when calling the call_wait routine.  These values indicate whether
 * the caller is waiting for 1) a network event, such as the arrival
 * of data, facks, etc., or 2) an internal event, such as
 * packets/reservations to become available.
 *
 * Note that this distinction is only meaningful for users of private sockets.
 * Call threads using private sockets wait for network events by sleeping in
 * recvfrom, and wait for internal events by sleeping on a condition variable.
 * Call threads that use shared sockets always wait on the call handle's
 * condition variable (i.e., always specify rpc_e_dg_wait_on_internal_event).
