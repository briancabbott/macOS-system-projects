**
**  DESCRIPTION:
**
**  Register the type UUID of an object with the Common Communications
**  Service. This routine is used in conjunction with rpc_server_register_if
**  to allow a server to support multiple implementations of the same
**  interface for different object types. Registering objects is required
**  only when generic interfaces are declared (via "rpc_server_register_if").
**  The Common Communications Service will dispatch to a specific
**  implementation, contained in a manager Entry Point Vector, based on the
**  object UUID contained in the binding of the RPC. The Common Communications
**  Service, using the results of a call to this routine, will determine
**  the type UUID of the object. A manager EPV for this type UUID can
**  then be found using the results of a call to the rpc_server_register_if
**  routine.
**
**  INPUTS:
**
**      object_uuid     The object to be registered.
