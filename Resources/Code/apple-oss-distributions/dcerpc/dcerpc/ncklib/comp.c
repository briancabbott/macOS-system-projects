 *
 * The global fork count used to detect when a process using
 * RPC has forked.  After a fork, the parent is allowed to proceed
 * unaffected--all RPC helper threads are restarted, and
 * all RPC state maintained.  In the child, however, all state
 * is dropped, and the RPC initialization process will have
 * to be repeated if the child tries to use RPC.
 *
 * The counter here is necessitated by the fact that it is possible
 * for the application to hold the only reference to certain
 * data structures allocated by the runtime;  the example of concern
 * here is binding handles.  Since we have no way at present
 * of tracking dow these binding handles during the normal fork
 * handling, we need some way to recognize them if the application
 * tries to use one *after* the fork.  By storing the current
 * global fork count in each handle, and then incrementing the
 * global count in the child of a fork, we can recognize such
 * handles the next time they are used.  Protocol specific routine
 * are then called to perform whatever actions are necessary to
 * drop any state associated with the handle.
 *
 * Note that we are currently stranding memory across forks; eg.
 * call handles, mutexes, etc.  This is considered a necessary and
 * acceptable evil based on the following considerations:
 *
 *     1) The reset/release/etc. routines that exist today are
 *        designed to carry out any pending operations associated
 *        with the data structure.  For example, before freeing
 *        a call handle, the DG code will try to send out any
 *        pending acknowledgements.  For this reason, most of
 *        these routines are unusable.
 *     2) It is too late to redesign all of these routines to
 *        incorporate the correct fork-aware behavior.
 *     3) Vaporizing all state in the child of a fork creates a
 *        scenario that is easier to understand, and implement
 *        correctly.
 *     4) The amount of memory stranded does not seem to be enough
 *        to worry about.  We are assuming that the child of
 *        a fork will not itself fork a child that will itself
 *        fork a child, etc., eventually filling the VA space
 *        with stranded memory.

 *
 * The RPC Authentication Protocol ID table.
 *
 * Each RPC Authentication protocol has an entry in this table.  These
 * entries include the following fields:
 *
 *      auth_init           The address of an initialization routine in the
 *                          Authentication Service that will be called by
 *                          rpc__init.
 *
 *      authn_protocol_id   A constant identifier for this Authentication Service.
 *
 *      dce_rpc_authn_protocol_id_t
 *                          The value that goes into RPC protocol messages to
 *                          identify which authentication protocol is in use.
 *
 *      epv                 An entry point vector for the Authentication Service
 *                          functions.
 *
 * Note that the ".authn_protocol_id" field of i'th element in the table
 * is always "i".  While redundant, this is useful so that you can pass
 * pointers to individual table elements.
 *
 * Note that the ".auth_protocol_id" contains API values (see
 * "rpc_c_authn_..." constants in "rpc.idl").
 * "dce_rpc_authn_protocol_id_t" contains architectural values that appear
 * in network messages (see "dce_c_rpc_authn_protocol_..." constants in
 * "nbase.idl").
