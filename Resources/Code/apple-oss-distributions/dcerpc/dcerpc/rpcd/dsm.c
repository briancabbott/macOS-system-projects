**  NAME:
**
**      dsm.c
**
**  FACILITY:
**
**      Data Storage Manager (DSM)
**
**  ABSTRACT:
**
**  The DSM implements a heap storage interface wherein records are strongly
**  associated with records in a file, such that they can be stably stored
**  upon modification.  The basic paradigm is that the client ALLOCATEs a
**  block of some requested size, modifies it in memory, and WRITEs it;
**  successful completion of the WRITE implies that the record has been stably
**  stored in the file.  DSM makes this assumption about the underlying file
**  system and operations thereon: there is a basic page size which is well
**  known (compile time constant), and file operations operate on pages as
**  units.  In particular, a write operation which is entirely within a page
**  (i.e. a write of a page or a subset of a page) will succeed or fail
**  atomically, with no intermediate state.  We use this to stably write
**  new blocks, and free existing ones.  There is no atomic update operation;
**  the caller must establish protocol for doing updates of existing records.
**
**  The memory model is simple.  The heap file begins with a header page
**  containing version information etc. (including the size of the stably
**  initialized portion of the file).  The rest of the file is some integral
**  number of pages long, with records laid out in sequence.  Each record
**  begins with a preheader (to us it's a header, to the client application
**  an invisible preheader) which contains the offset of the record in the
**  file (so we can easily update that record), the size of the record not
**  including the preheader, a 'link' field used to string the free list
**  in memory, a 'free' indication, and a 'magic cookie' used to flag validly
**  allocated records in memory.  The portion of the record after the preheader
**  is what we give the client; note that there may be slop at the end of
**  the record beyond the amount of space requested, for alignment.  The
**  preheader and the data portion of the record are both aligned to an 8-byte
**  boundary.  The first 64 bytes of each record, including the preheader,
**  fit within a page, so the preheader (16 bytes currently) and the first
**  48 bytes of the user data can be atomically updated.
**
**  When initially created, no data pages are allocated to the file (just
**  the header is filled in).  When the file needs to grow (because no suitable
**  free block is available) it is extended by an integral number of pages,
**  at least large enough to accomodate the client request, and at least
**  a minimum size.  A chunk of memory of the growth size is allocated at
**  the same time to act as the virtual mirror of this new section of the
**  file.  As the file grows over time a list of such chunks is formed.  When
**  a preexisting file is opened a single chunk representing the actual length
**  of the file is created, and the entire file read into it.  Within memory
**  a free list is constructed linking all free blocks; this list is
**  reconstructed at open time by traversing the entire (virtual) file.
**
**  A given data store can be specified to be volatile at open/create time
**  by giving a null or empty filename, in which case there will be no backing
**  file.  This allows PL/I-style storage areas, where an arbitrary number
**  of records can be allocated in memory in a data store and freed with
**  a single operation of closing the data store handle, whereas each record
**  would have to be kept track of and freed individually with conventional
**  malloc.
**

    significantly larger than the one requested, we split it up by making
    a new free block from everything but the reqested amount (rounded up
    to an 8-byte boundary).  The header of the allocated block is marked
    with a "magic cookie" to let us do at least minimal validity checking
    on incoming pointers.

    Per datastore we maintain a count of "pending" records -- records that
    are free in the datastore, but the application holds pointers to them,
    as a result of dsm_allocate, or dsm_detach.  We don't want to
    coalesce the database while these are held because presumably the

    We don't support an atomic update operation (replacing an existing record

    (presumably flagged so as to distinguish it in case of a crash) and then
    free the old one (finally unflagging the new one).  An update can also be
    considered a delete and an add, and the application must either not care
    if only the delete succeeds, or have some way of recovering (replaying a
    log etc.).  For such applications we provide a 'detach' operation.  Detach
    is similar to free; the effect is that if a crash occurs between the detach
    and write phases of an update, the block in question is effectively freed,
    i.e. upon restarting the record being updated will have been deleted.

    Many applications want to support records too long to avoid spanning

    want to update atomically, such as "deleted" or "new" flags.  DSM
    guarantees that the first part of each record up to dsm_hdr_size [48]
    bytes can be written atomically, and so updated in place without having
    to worry about detaching.  dsm_write_hdr is like dsm_write except
    that an additional parameter specifies the number of bytes to write
    -- a typical call probably being:

        dsm_write_hdr(my_dsh,my_rec,sizeof(myrec.hdr),&status);

    Note - we'll count this as a pending record if it's free, but the
    caller is in charge, in such cases, of ensuring that this write is
    sufficient to stably reflect the record.

    Successively returns each non-free block in the data store.  We are
    passed (by reference) a marker which we interpret as a file offset
    in the data store.  The marker points to the last block examined; a
    special invalid offset as set by dsm_marker_reset will see the first
    non-free block, otherwise the next non-free block after that identified
    by the marker will be returned.  The marker is updated, and a pointer
    to the record filled in.  A status of dsm_err_no_more_entries will
    be returned when no more valid entries exist (i.e. on the call *after*
    the last valid entry is seen).  Thus the complete set of allocated
    records can be traversed by calling dsm_marker_reset and then
    repeatedly calling dsm_read with that marker as long as the status
    is status_ok.

    A single-tasked process making consecutive calls to dsm_read without
    other dsm calls will see all allocated records.  However in general it
    is possible for a marker to become stale, as could happen during a
    coalesce operation.  We maintain a small cache of valid marker values,
    cleared upon coalescing; if a given marker value is not cached, then
    we scan the data store from some earlier known valid block loooking
    for the first allocated block at a higher offset than the nominal
    marker value (at worst we might have to scan the entire data store;
    the problem is that with variable-length records it's hard to find an
    anchor point).
*** heuristics can be applied: scanning the free list
    can generate valid record starts, as can scanning the memory map (chunk
    list), as can scanning the valid marker cache.

/*  cache handling

    We maintain, per database, a cache of location/pointer values for use
    by dsm_read.  The cache is cleared initially and upon coalesce(),
    and the location/pointer pair returned by successful dsm_read is
    entered in the cache.  The size of the cache depends on the expected
    pattern of dsm_read calls.

    Currently the cache is trivial: one deep.  This assumes that dsm_read
    will be called sequentially to read the database in a single thread,
    there won't be multiple tasks simultaneously reading the same database,
    and markers to older records won't be saved.  If any of these occur
    then the cost of dsm_read will go up, as many records must be scanned
    (depending on get_earlier_block()) for each cache miss.

    We have a special case for lookups in a recently opened data store - one
    that's still in a single memory chunk and which has not been coalesced;
    in this case the address can be computed from the chunk address and the
    file offset.  (This could be extended beyond a single chunk but since we
    always coalesce before allocating a new chunk it avails not).  Once you've
    coalesced the boundaries of blocks have changed, and stale pointers or
    markers could point other than to the beginning of a block.
