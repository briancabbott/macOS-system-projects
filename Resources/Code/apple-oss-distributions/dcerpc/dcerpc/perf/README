Perf Test Suite
============================================

The perf tests has to be run as two different processes -
a perf server and a perf client. The perf server need to be started
before a perf client process can be invoked.

Various RPC request combinations can be tested as input to
perf client process.

The following scripts are provided to execute a minimal set
of perf tests:
	run_client.sh (can be run with both tcp and udp).
	perf_udp.sh
	perf_tcp.sh

Usage of these scripts:
run_client.sh `string binding returned by server`
perf_udp.sh server_host_name client_program_directory
perf_tcp.sh server_host_name client_program_directory

Before executing any of these scripts, a server need to started
with appropriate protseq_spec.

An example run  of these scripts involve starting the server:

        ./server 1 ncadg_ip_udp
              ==> returns binding, such as ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.4.102[2001]
         run_client.sh 'ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.4.102[2001]'
	 perf_udp.sh server_host_name .
or
        ./server 1 ncacn_ip_tcp
              ==> returns binding, such as ncacn_ip_tcp:130.105.4.102[2001]
         run_client.sh 'ncacn_ip_tcp:130.105.4.102[2001]'
	 perf_tcp.sh server_host_name .

The alternate methods of executing the perf tests are provided
in the DCE Porting and Testing Guide.
