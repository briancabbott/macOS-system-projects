## Mailing lists

For questions, answers, feedback and other general discussion please
join the [mailing list][mailing-list]. Changes to the DCE/RPC source
code will also be posted to there.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, please open
a [Trac ticket][trac].

## Projects

There a lots of interesting project to work on in DCE/RPC. Here
are some ideas:

* Clean up dce_error_inq_text to use error_status_t and
  dce_error_string_t parameters.

* Not all errors are in the message catalogue, eg.
  rpc_s_protseq_not_supported is missing. Need to find and
  catalogue all errors.

* Fix the IDL compiler so that [in] reference parameters are
  declared with the const qualifier.

* Add support for [out,unique] parameters as used in the spoolss
  protocol.

* Add launchd (Mac OS X) and systemd (Linux) support to rpcd.

### Projects specific to Mac OS X

* Implement a ncacn_mach transport for local RPC on Mac OS X.

* Add instant-off support to the RPC runtime.

* Replace the DCEThreads runtime with [libdispatch][libdispatch].
