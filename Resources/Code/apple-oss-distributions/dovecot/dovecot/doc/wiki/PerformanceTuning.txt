Dovecot performance tuning
==========================

Disk I/O optimization
---------------------

Usually heavily loaded IMAP and POP3 servers don't use much CPU, but they use
all the disk I/O they can get. So reducing disk I/O is probably the most useful
optimization you can do.

 * See <MailLocation.LocalDisk.txt> for generic disk I/O optimizations.
 * See <MailLocation.Mbox.txt> for mbox-specific optimizations.
 * See <MailLocation.Maildir.txt> for Maildir-specific optimizations.
 * See <dbox> [MailboxFormat.dbox.txt] for Dovecot's own high-performance
   mailbox format. It usually gives much better performance than mbox/Maildir.
 * See <full text search indexes> [Plugins.FTS.txt] for optimizing IMAP SEARCH
   command.
 * See <POP3Server.txt> for POP3 optimizations, especially
   'pop3_no_flag_updates=yes'

CPU usage optimization
----------------------

 * See <LoginProcess.txt> for optimizing CPU usage caused by logins
 * See 'auth_cache_size' setting for caching passdb and userdb lookups
 * Services having client_limit>1 and process_limit>1, set process_min_avail to
   the number of CPU cores
 * To reduce forks by reusing existing processes for new requests increase
   'service { service_count }' from 1 to higher (e.g. 100) for imap and pop3
   services. It's better not to set it too high or unlimited (0), because
   different users use different amounts of memory, and it's wasteful when a
   lot of processes end up having a lot of "free" memory.

Memory usage optimization
-------------------------

There aren't many settings which affect Dovecot's memory usage. About the only
such settings are 'auth_cache_size' and <LoginProcess.txt> settings. In general
Dovecot uses as much memory as it needs, which is usually quite little.

Note that these settings do not directly affect the memory usage:

 * 'service { vsz_limit } ': These are simply safe guards against potential
   memory leaks. If the process's virtual size reaches the limit, the process
   is killed by the kernel.
 * 'service { process_limit, client_limit } ': These are mostly to avoid DoS
   attacks using up all your memory.
