Migration from Gmail to Dovecot
===============================

You can use <dsync migration via IMAP> [Migration.Dsync.txt] protocol, but
there are a few things different with Gmail compared to other IMAP servers:

 * With Gmail when you delete a mail from POP3, the mail is only hidden from
   future POP3 sessions, but it's still available via IMAP. If you wish to
   preserve this functionality, there's a 'pop3_deleted_flag' setting in
   Dovecot v2.2.2+.
 * Gmail has labels. If a message has multiple labels, it shows up in multiple
   IMAP folders, but it's still the same message and uses quota only once for
   that message. Dovecot currently doesn't have such support, so the migration
   will copy the message to multiple folders and each instance will use up
   quota. There's currently no easy fix for this, although there are some
   future plans to optionally not count message copies towards quota.
 * Gmail has virtual folders: "All Mail", "Starred" and "Important". From
   migration point of view this means that the migration should skip these
   folders, since their mails are in other folders anyway. With v2.2.3+ you can
   tell dsync to skip these folders:'doveadm sync -x '\All' -x '\Flagged' -x
   '\Important'' - by using the \flag parameters dsync finds the folders by
   their SPECIAL-USE flag rather than their name (which may be different for
   different user depending on their language).
