SASL
====

SASL stands for "Simple Authentication and Security Layer". SASL itself is
nothing more than a list of requirements for <authentication mechanisms>
[Authentication.Mechanisms.txt] and protocols to be SASL-compatible as
described in RFC 4422 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4422.txt]. IMAP, POP3 and
SMTP protocols all have support for SASL.

Many people confuse SASL with one specific SASL implementation: the Cyrus SASL
library. Dovecot has its own SASL implementation which may at some point be
separated from Dovecot itself to "compete" against Cyrus SASL library in server
side.

Dovecot SASL can already be used with:

 * Postfix *v2.3* and later. See <HowTo.PostfixAndDovecotSASL.txt> for details.

 * Exim *v4.64* and later. See <HowTo.EximAndDovecotSASL.txt> for details.

Hopefully more software will follow.
