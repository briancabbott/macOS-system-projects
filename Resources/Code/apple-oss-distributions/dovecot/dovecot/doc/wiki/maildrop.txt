Maildrop
========

Maildrop is available at http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop

Although it is the default LDA for the courier mail server, it also works as a
standalone LDA.  The install script can even build an rpm package if you prefer
to manage software that way.  Maildrop can be used with sendmail as a drop-in
replacement for procmail.  It has better maildir support than procmail and it
has filtering capability using syntax that looks a lot like shell script
language with a little bit of perl thrown in.

To use maildrop with sendmail, make the following change in your sendmail.mc
file, then make etc.

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
dnl FEATURE(`local_procmail,', `procmail -t -Y -a $h -d $u')dnl
dnl # replace above line with below line to use maildrop instead of procmail
FEATURE(`local_procmail', `/usr/bin/maildrop', `maildrop -d $u')dnl
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A default system wide configuration file for maildir style mailboxes might look
like the following:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# file: /etc/maildroprc
# system-wide settings for maildrop

SHELL="/bin/bash"
SENDMAIL="/usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t"
logfile "/var/log/maildrop.log"

DEFAULT="$HOME/Maildir/"
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above configuration, the users should be a member of the same group and
the group should have write privileges to the logfile.

To use maildrop with Postfix, take a look at

Dovecot Authentication extension for maildrop
---------------------------------------------

Announced on the Dovecot's mailing list:
http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2009-April/039121.html

A patch for maildrop that would allow it to perform user lookups directly
against Dovecot in a similar way how they are done by Dovecot's LDA deliver
depending on used version of maildrop is available at the following locations:

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

When this patch is applied, maildrop will be extended with another command line
option "-t", which can be used to specify the location of Dovecot's master auth
socket that will be used when performing user lookups. There's a readme file
(README.dovecotauth) together with patch with a little bit more information
regarding the use of this extension.
