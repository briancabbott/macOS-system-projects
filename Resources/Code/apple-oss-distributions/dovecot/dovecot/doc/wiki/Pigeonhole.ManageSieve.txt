Pigeonhole ManageSieve Server
=============================

The <Pigeonhole project> [Pigeonhole.txt] provides Sieve [http://sieve.info]
support for Dovecot, which allows users to filter incoming messages by writing
scripts specified in the Sieve language (RFC 5228). The PigeonholeManageSieve
service is used to manage a user's Sieve script collection. It has the
following advantages over doing it directly via filesystem:

 * No need to let users log in via FTP/SFTP/etc, which could be difficult
   especially with virtual users.
 * ManageSieve is a standard protocol [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5804], so
   users can manage their scripts using (hopefully) user-friendlyManageSieve
   clients. Many webmails already include aManageSieve client.
 * Scripts are compiled before they are installed, which guarantees that the
   uploaded script is valid. This prevents a user from inadvertently installing
   a broken Sieve script.
