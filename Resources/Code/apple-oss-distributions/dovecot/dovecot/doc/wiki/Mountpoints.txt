Mountpoints
===========

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
master: Warning: /mnt/foo is no longer mounted. See
http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Mountpoints
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dovecot wants to keep track of mountpoints that might contain emails. If such a
mountpoint is suddenly not mounted, it's handled as an error condition rather
than as "this is a new user". This prevents other confusion that follows such a
situation.

Removing mountpoints
--------------------

If you permanently removed a mountpoint, you can tell Dovecot to forget about
it with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
doveadm mount remove /mnt/foo
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ignoring mountpoints
--------------------

Dovecot already internally filters out many mountpoints and filesystems that
are pretty much guaranteed not to contain any emails, but of course it can't
know about everything. This is especially problematic with filesystems that are
sometimes mounted and sometimes not. You can permanently tell Dovecot to ignore
a mountpoint with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
doveadm mount add /mnt/foo ignore
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

or ignore all mountpoints under '/mnt':

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
doveadm mount add '/mnt/*' ignore
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding mountpoints
------------------

Mountpoints are added automatically when Dovecot starts up. If you mount a new
filesystem with mails while Dovecot is running you can also add it manually:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
doveadm mount add /mnt/foo
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
