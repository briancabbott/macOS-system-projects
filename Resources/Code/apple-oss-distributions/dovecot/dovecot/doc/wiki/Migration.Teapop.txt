Teapop 0.3.8
============

*WARNING: Badly done migration will cause your IMAP and/or POP3 clients to
re-download all mails. Read <Migration.txt> page first carefully.*

First at all sorry for my bad English. At work I had to migrate our existing
teapop/mbox setup to Dovecot/Maildir without change the UIDL. At first I think
I must set the option pop3_uidl_format to %Mf. But this doesn't work because
Teapop use different algorithm. So the only way I found was to set the X-UIDL
in the mbox and then use the mb2md script. My Co-worker Robert (many thanks for
programming the script) and I use the following script:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Digest::MD5;
$context = Digest::MD5->new;
$gotmail = 0;
$counter = 1;
@mail = ();
while (<>)
{
    $line = $_;
    if(/^From /)
    {
        if ($gotmail)
        {
            processMail ();
            $counter++;
            $context->reset();
            @mail = ();
        }
        $gotmail = 1;
    }
    push (@mail, $line);
    next if ($line =~ /^(Status|X-Status|Lines|Content-Length): /);
    $context->add($line);
}
if ($gotmail)
{
    processMail ();
}
else
{
    print STDERR "Mailbox is empty!\n";
}
sub processMail ()
{
    if ($#mail > 2)
    {
        print shift(@mail);
        print shift(@mail);
        print "X-UIDL: " . $context->hexdigest() . "\n";
        foreach $l (@mail)
        {
            print $l;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        print STDERR "Email has less then 3 lines!\n";
    }
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: scriptname $mboxfile > $newbox

The script read the mbox file and generate the MD5 sum, if the line don't start
with Status,X-Status,Lines and Content-Length, for each mail and insert the
X-UIDL: after the Return-Path line. After that you can use the mb2md
script.Important: You must set the 'pop3_reuse_xuidl=yes'.
