Shadow
======

Works at least with Linux and Solaris, but nowadays <PAM>
[PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt] is usually preferred to this.

This uses auth worker processes:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
passdb {
  driver = shadow
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are only a few users and you're using '/etc/shadow' file, there's
really no need to use auth workers. You can disable them with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
passdb {
  driver = shadow
  args = blocking=no
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
