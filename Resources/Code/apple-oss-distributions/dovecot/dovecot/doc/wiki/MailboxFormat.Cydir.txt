Cydir
=====

This mailbox format is very similar to Cyrus IMAP's internal mail store:

 * Messages are stored in "<uid>." named files
 * Cyrus's 'cyrus.index' is equivalent to Dovecot's 'dovecot.index'. Dovecot
   however also requires 'dovecot.index.log' for its indexing to work.
 * Cyrus's 'cyrus.cache' is equivalent to Dovecot's 'dovecot.index.cache'.

Cydir is a very simple format internally. It relies on Dovecot's <index files>
[IndexFiles.txt] completely for its functionality. If the index files are lost,
all the message flags are lost. Currently the code can't even rebuild index
files if they're lost.

Cydir is mostly meant to be used for benchmarking and stress testing index
handling code. Its code is small and simple, so it can also act as an example
for writing new mail storage backends.
