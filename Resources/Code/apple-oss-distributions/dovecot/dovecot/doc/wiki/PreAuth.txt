Pre-Authenticated Sessions
==========================

For debugging purpose or to perform IMAP actions on-behalf of an user, you can
use pre-authenticated sessions. You can do this by simply running:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/local/libexec/dovecot/imap
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

And you can start talking IMAP via stdin/stdout. This doesn't change process's
UID, GID, or get any userdb settings. If you want to emulate a full regular
login, you can execute

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/local/libexec/dovecot/imap -u username
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, you may need to run the above command as root if it needs to change
process's uid/gid.
