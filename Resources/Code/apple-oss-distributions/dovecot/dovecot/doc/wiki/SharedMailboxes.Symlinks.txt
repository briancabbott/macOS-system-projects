Mailbox sharing with symlinks
=============================

It's possible to share mailboxes simply by symlinking them among user's private
mailboxes. See <SharedMailboxes.Permissions.txt> for issues related to
filesystem permissions.

Maildir
-------

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ln -s /home/user2/Maildir/.Work /home/user1/Maildir/.shared.user2
ln -s /home/user3/Maildir/.Work /home/user1/Maildir/.shared.user3
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now user1 has a "shared" directory containing "user2" and "user3" child
mailboxes, which point to those users' "Work" mailbox.

With Maildir++ layout it's not possible to automatically share "mailbox and its
children". You'll need to symlink each mailbox separately. With v1.1+ you could
do this by using "fs" layout for mailboxes (requires converting existing
maildirs from Maildir++).

mbox
----

Doing the same as in the above Maildir example:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir /home/user1/mail/shared
ln -s /home/user2/mail/Work /home/user1/mail/shared/user2
ln -s /home/user3/mail/Work /home/user1/mail/shared/user3
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

One additional problem with mbox format is the creation of dotlock files. The
dotlocks would be created under user1's directory, which makes them useless.
Make sure the locking works properly with only fcntl or flock locking (See
<MboxLocking.txt>) and just disable dotlocks. Alternatively instead of
symlinking an mbox file, put the shared mailboxes inside a directory and
symlink the entire directory.
