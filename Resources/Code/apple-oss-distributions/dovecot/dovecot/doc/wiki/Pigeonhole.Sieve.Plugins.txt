Pigeonhole Sieve Plugins
========================

The Pigeonhole Sieve interpreter can be dynamically extended with new features
by means of plugins. Plugins can be configured using the 'sieve_plugins'
setting in the 'plugin' section of the Dovecot configuration, as explained on
the <Pigeonhole Sieve Configuration page> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.Configuration.txt].

The following plugins are currently available for the Pigeonhole Sieve
interpeter:

 * <Extdata> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.Plugins.Extdata.txt] /(custom language
   extension, experimental)/
 * This plugin adds support for the Dovecot-specific 'vnd.dovecot.extdata'
   extension, which allows access to external string data. Any type of Dovecot
   dict lookup can be specified as data source.
 * <Pipe> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.Plugins.Pipe.txt] [*Pigeonhole v0.2*] /(custom
   language extension, experimental)/
 * This plugin adds support for the Dovecot-specific 'vnd.dovecot.pipe'
   extension, which allows piping messages to a pre-defined set of external
   programs. For Pigeonhole v0.3, the same functionality (and more) is provided
   by the extprograms plugin.
 * <Extprograms> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.Plugins.Extprograms.txt] [*Pigeonhole v0.3*
   and beyond]/(custom language extensions, experimental)/
 * This plugin adds support for the Dovecot-specific 'vnd.dovecot.pipe',
   'vnd.dovecot.filter' and 'vnd.dovecot.execute' extensions. These extensions
   add new action commands for invoking a predefined set of external programs
   (typically shell scripts. Messages can be piped to or filtered through those
   programs and string data can be input to and retrieved from those programs.
