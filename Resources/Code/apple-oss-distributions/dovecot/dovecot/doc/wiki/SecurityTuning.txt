Security tuning
===============

Dovecot is pretty secure out-of-the box. It uses multiple processes and
privilege separation to isolate different parts from each others in case a
security hole is found from one part.

Some things you can do more:

 * Allocate each user their own UID and GID (see <UserIds.txt>)
 * Use a separate /dovecot-auth/ user for authentication process (see
   <UserIds.txt>)
 * You can chroot authentication and mail processes (see <Chrooting.txt>)
 * Compiling Dovecot with garbage collection ('--with-gc' configure option)
   fixes at least in theory any security holes caused by double free()s.
   However this hasn't been tested much and there may be problems.
 * There are some security related SSL settings (see
   <SSL.DovecotConfiguration.txt>)
 * Set 'first/last_valid_uid/gid' settings to contain only the range actually
   used by mail processes
