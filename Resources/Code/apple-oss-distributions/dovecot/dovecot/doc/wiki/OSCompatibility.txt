Operating System Compatibility
==============================

Dovecot is commonly used with Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and Mac
OS X. The following operating systems have also worked at least at some point
in Dovecot's existence:

 * BSD/OS 4.2
 * AIX 4.3
 * HP-UX 11i (Dovecot v1.1+)
 * Tru64 ?.?
 * UnixWare 7.1.4
 * IRIX 6.5 compiles, but SCM_RIGHTS seems to be broken.
 * Cygwin apparently doesn't work nowadays.
 * MidnightBSD (ports)

If there are compiling problems with any OS, please send a bug report that
includes the error messages.

SCM_RIGHTS
----------

There is one slightly problematic feature that Dovecot requires for
implementing privilege separation:*SCM_RIGHTS*. If it doesn't work correctly,
you'll get errors on 'fd_send()' or 'fd_read()' such as:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
imap-login: fd_send(X) failed: Bad file number
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this happens, you can still use inetd and mailfront
[http://untroubled.org/mailfront/], which executes Dovecot's post-login IMAP or
POP3 binary. You can also try defining 'BUGGY_CMSG_MACROS' in
'src/lib/fdpass.c' to see if it helps.

Compilers
---------

Dovecot should compile with any ANSI-C99 compiler. Dovecot has been known to
compile (at least once in its lifetime) with the following compilers:

 * GCC
 * Clang
 * Intel CC [http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/clin/]
 * Tiny CC [http://www.tinycc.org]
 * Sun Studio 11
 * Sun Studio 12
 * AIX xlC
 * HP-UX cc
