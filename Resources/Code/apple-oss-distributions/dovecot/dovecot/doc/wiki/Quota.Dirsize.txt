Dirsize quota
=============

The /dirsize/ quota backend supports *storage* quota limits, but not *messages*
quota limits. The current quota is calculated by finding all files in
configured mail directories and summing up their sizes. This works pretty fast
with mboxes, but *dirsize is a really bad idea with maildirs*. It will end up
eating all your CPU and disk I/O.

Example
-------

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
plugin {
  # 10MB quota limit
  quota = dirsize:User quota
  quota_rule = *:storage=10M
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
