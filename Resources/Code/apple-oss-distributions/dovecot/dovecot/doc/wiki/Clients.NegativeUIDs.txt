Negative UIDs
=============

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invalid messageset: 1181461470:-1181461446.
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMAP uses unsigned 32bit integers for unique message identifiers. Unfortunately
a lot of IMAP clients use 32bit signed integers, which means that if the UIDs
go higher than 2147483647, they'll wrap to negative integers. This causes
errors such as above.

However normally the UIDs should never go that high, so it's possible to avoid
this problem.

mbox
----

Earlier Dovecot versions had bugs which could cause X-UID: headers in incoming
messages to grow the UIDs too high. Some spam messages especially contained
these intentionally broken X-UID: headers.

With newer Dovecot versions these broken X-UID: headers aren't practically ever
used. It happens only if the mail has a valid X-IMAPbase: header, X-UID: header
and the mail is written to an empty mbox file. Note that this can happen only
new mboxes, because expunging all messages in a mailbox causes Dovecot to
create a metadata message at the beginning of the mbox file.

In any case it's still a good idea to filter out X-UID: and other metadata
headers in your MDA. <Dovecot's deliver> [LDA.txt] does this internally. See
<MboxProblems.txt> for a list of headers to filter out.

Fixing
------

Fixing is done by letting Dovecot update UIDVALIDITY value and recreate the
UIDs beginning from one. This means that client's local cache will be
invalidated and the client will be required to download all the messages again.

mbox
----

Delete Dovecot's index files (eg. '.imap/INBOX/') and X-IMAP: and X-IMAPbase:
headers from the mbox file.

Maildir
-------

This should really never be a problem with Maildir. If however you have managed
to cause it somehow (by receiving 2 billion mails?), you can recreate the UIDs
by deleting 'dovecot-uidlist' file.
