Trash Plugin
============

This requires <quota plugin> [Quota.txt] to be loaded and configured to use
non- <FS quota> [Quota.FS.txt].

Normally if a message can't be saved/copied because it would bring user over
quota, the save/copy fails with "Quota exceeded" error. The trash plugin can be
used to avoid such situations by making Dovecot automatically expunge oldest
messages from configured mailboxes until the message can be saved. If the new
message is large enough that it wouldn't fit even if all messages from
configured mailboxes were expunged, then none are and user gets the "Quota
exceeded" error.

The configuration file is a text file where each line is in format: '<priority>
<mailbox name>'. Mails are deleted in lowest -> highest priority number order.

dovecot.conf:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_plugins = $mail_plugins quota trash

plugin {
  trash = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-trash.conf.ext
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

dovecot-trash.conf.ext:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Spam mailbox is emptied before Trash
1 Spam
# Trash mailbox is emptied before Sent
2 Trash
# If both Sent and "Sent Messages" mailboxes exist, the next oldest message
# to be deleted is looked up from both of the mailboxes.
3 Sent
3 Sent Messages
