.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ocs
[-x] [-f] [-q] [-u] 
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents 
.B ocs
, a shell script wrapper that automates the creation and maintainence of a 
.BR cscope(1)
database on a recursive set of directories. Under normal circumstances,
.B ocs
generates a cscope database on a recursive group of directories starting from the current working directory, before launching
.BR cscope(1)
in interactive mode.
.br

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP -x 
Enable debugging.
.br
.B
.IP -f
Force. Do not ask about regenerating 'TMP' lists (lists generated by
.B ocs
), just do it; Allow the regeneration of 'CSD' (lists generated by
.BR cscope(1)
) lists.
.br

.IP -q 
Tell cscope to build a fast reverse index. Database disk space usage is doubled, but searching speed is increased.

.IP -u
Request that the database be updated or regenerated.
