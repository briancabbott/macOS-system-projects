This is a summary of user visible changes in srm.

release-1_2_8

	Documentation updates.

release-1_2_7

	Minor bugfixes. Correctly handle symlinks. Build with most
	recent versions of automake.

release-1_2_6

	BSD variant fixes. Display verbose messages when -f and -v are
	both specified.

release-1_2_5

	Updated README coverage. Fixed a rare deadlock.

release-1_2_4

	Build on tru64 and Solaris.

release-1_2_3

	None. However, a file descriptor leak is plugged.

release-1_2_2

	-f now really does ignore nonexistant files.

release-1_2_1

	srm will now try and chmod() files without write permission if
	the user answers yes at the "Remove write-protected file?"
	prompt or when -f is specified. Note that chmod() will fail
	unless you own the file, however.

release-1_2_0

	Fixed .spec for rpm 4.

release-1_1_0

	A massive restructuring to allow automake support (no more bad
	dependancies), cleaner integration of third-party modules (no
	more phony snprintf on Irix, a cleaner tree_walker coming
	soon), and an rpm distribution due to popular demand.

release-1_0_0

	Use sprintf()/vsprintf() when snprintf()/vsnprintf() are
	absent. This allows building on Irix 3.5.

release-0_9_2

	Dynamically search for /dev/urandom rather than at build time,
	to allow cross-compiling. Generic random module should allow
	use on systems without kernel entropy devices.

release-0_9_1

	Misc build patches for Solaris 2.7 from Gael Roualland.

release-0_9_0

	Added a new option, -s --simple, which only overwrites the
	file once, which is much faster than the default behavior.
	On BSD, check for immutable, append, and nounlink flags before
	overwriting data. Use nftw and a simple psuedo-random stream instead
	of fts and /dev/urandom when they are missing, this should allow
	building on more platforms.

release-0_8_3

	Added a missing overwrite pass. (Thanks to Gael Roualland for
	sharp proofreading)

release-0_8_2

	Fixed a bug which was truncating some error messages. Special
	files, and links are now renamed before removal. Fixed a bug
	which made it unable to remove files from filesystems other
	than ext2 under linux. (Thanks to Gael Roualland for reporting
	these three bugs) Added a Credits file.

release-0_8_1

	Fixed a bug where some writes were cached and not sent to
	disk.

release-0_8_0

	Use random, 14 character alphanumeric sequence to mask the
	file name rather than a name based on the original. Fixed some
	minor resource leaks which may have been apparant over
	extremly long runs. Removed the empty BUGS and TODO lists, and
	added this list of changes.

release-0_7_0

	Improved ext2 support, srm will not attempt to shred files
	which have the undeletable, immutable, or append-only
	attributes set. Ext2 support is always enabled on Linux now,
	even if the ext2 development libraries are not installed.

release-0_6_0

	Improved file locking, srm now tries to lock the file before
	overwriting, avoiding trashing locked files.

release-0_5_0

	Improved hard link handling, srm will now only overwrite files
	when removing the last link.

release-0_4_0

	Improved error handling. Removed a bug where some recursive
	runs would fail.

release-0_3_0

	Added a configure script and ported to BSD.

release-0_2_0

	Added man page.

release-0_1_1

	Fixed bug which caused srm to fail when removing files on
	different file systems.

release-0_1_0

	First working version.
