// kI2CUCBufSize defines the size of the byte stream that is passed between
// user space and kernel space for both reads and writes.  ALL I2C
// transactions performed through the user client are constrained by
// this buffer size.  In addition, the in-kernel user client checks to
// make sure that the buffer is the correct size before accepting the
// transaction.  Unless you are changing it in both the in-kernel code
// and the user-space device interface code, DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE!!!

// Clients to PPCI2CInterface are required to bracket their bus usage
// by opening and closing the I2C bus.  This is done by calling
// openI2CBus and closeI2CBus methods.  PPCI2CInterface does checks to
// make sure that the thread making read, write, mode change or close
// requests is the same one that made the last open request.  Presumably,
// if a thread opens the I2C bus and then dies without closing the bus,
// the bus is stuck open and all other clients are permanently locked
// out of the bus.
//
// In order to avoid this from happening, I2CUserClient must ensure that
// any operation which requires a bus open operation is completed
// atomically before the thread returns to the calling application.

// Read operations pass an I2CReadInput struct and get their results
// in an I2CReadOutput struct.  The number of bytes requested is passed
// with the inputs, and the number of bytes successfully read is returned
// as an output, along with the data.  If the operation fails, an error
// code will be returned and realCount will be set to zero.

} I2CReadOutput;

// Write operations pass an I2CWriteInput struct.  After the write
// is performed, the number of bytes actually written is returned in
// an I2CWriteOutput struct.  If the operation failes, realCount
// will be set to zero and an appropriate error code will be returned.

// For a single byte read-modify-write cycle, use I2CRMWInput.  There
// is no data to be returned after such an operation, just success or
// failure, so there is no output structure used.  The caller must
// specify the transaction mode for both the read and the subsequent
// write operation, between which the bus is held open to make the
// operation atomic.  A byte is read from the target, and is modified
// as such:
//   newbyte = (byte & ~mask) | (value & mask);
// Then newbyte is written back to the target (at the same addr/subaddr),
// the bus is released and status is returned to the caller.
