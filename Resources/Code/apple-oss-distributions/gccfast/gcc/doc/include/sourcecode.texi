@unnumbered Source Code

The source code for Apple's versions of GCC is available using
anonymous CVS, from
@samp{:pserver:anonymous@@anoncvs.opensource.apple.com:/cvs/root}
with password @samp{anonymous}, as module @samp{gcc3}.

For example, you can fetch the latest version by entering:

@smallexample
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@@anoncvs.opensource.apple.com:/cvs/root login
Password: anonymous
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@@anoncvs.opensource.apple.com:/cvs/root -z6 \
  co gcc3
@end smallexample

Each version will be tagged based on its build number, which
you can find by executing @samp{gcc --version}; for instance, if this prints

@smallexample
gcc (GCC) 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1402)
@end smallexample

then the build number is 1402.  Some older compilers may require you
use @samp{gcc -v} to obtain the build number.  Most versions are
tagged like @samp{gcc-1402}; you can find a list of suitable tags with
a command like @samp{cvs log gcc3/gcc/version.c}.  Once you have the
tag, you can use the @samp{-r} flag to CVS, for instance

@smallexample
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@@anoncvs.opensource.apple.com:/cvs/root -z6 \
    co -r gcc-1402 gcc3
@end smallexample
