<h1>Mac OS X 10.3 Xcode release:<br>GCC 3.3</h1>

<p>
These notes describe Apple's GCC 3.3, which is based on version 3.3 of the
Free Software Foundation's GNU Compiler Collection. GCC 3.3 will be the
default compiler on Mac OS X for C, C++, Objective-C, and
Objective-C++ source code after this package is installed.  GCC 3.1,
which was the default compiler in the Mac OS X 10.2 Development Tools,
continues to be provided for backward compatibility.  GCC 2.95 is also
still provided for backward compatibility.
</p>

<p>These release notes are not comprehensive.  For a
complete list of compiler changes, please also consult the <a
href="Compiler.html">release notes for the compiler in the Mac OS X
Developer Tools 10.1 release.</a></p>

<H2>Switching to GCC 3.3</H2>

<p>
The Xcode Tools package provides three compilers: GCC 2, based
on version 2.95 of the Free Software  Foundation's GCC compiler suite,
GCC 3 (also called GCC 3.1), based on version 3.1 of the Free Software
Foundation's GCC compiler suite, and GCC 3.3, which is based on
version 3.3 of the Free Software  Foundation's GCC compiler suite.
</p>
<p>
Here are some important things to keep in mind before you switch from
GCC 2 or GCC 3.1 to GCC 3.3:
</p>
<UL>
<li> Recompile all your C++ and Objective-C++ code, including all
libraries and frameworks that export a C++ interface.  The application
binary interface (ABI) for C++ programs changed between GCC 2 and GCC
3.1, and again between GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.3.  The changes between GCC 2
and GCC 3.1 were comprehensive, including changes to name mangling,
exception handling, and class layout and alignment.  The changes
between 3.1 and 3.3 are much smaller, but are still large enough to
prevent a mixed C++ program from operating correctly. <i>Do not link
C++ modules compiled with one of these compilers against modules
compiled with any of the other two compilers.</i>  Even if the modules
appear to link correctly, C++ ABI differences may still cause problems
that will not manifest themselves until run time.</li>
<li>You do not need to recompile C or Objective-C code. The C and
 Objective-C ABI has not changed.</li> 
<li> Do not ignore warnings. GCC 3.3 enforces the C and C++ standards
much more strictly. New warnings may point out errors that GCC 2 or
GCC 3.1 overlooked.</li>
<li>Test your code. Even if the compiler doesn't raise any errors or
warnings, your code may rely on idiosyncrasies in GCC 2 or GCC 3.1
that GCC 3.3 handles differently.</li> 
<li> If you're creating kernel extensions that must run on Mac OS X
10.1 and earlier, you must use GCC 2. If the extensions will run only
on Mac OS X 10.2 and later, you should use GCC 3.1 or GCC 3.3.</li> 
</UL>

<H3>Switching between compilers</H3>

<p>
All three compilers may coexist on the same system. GCC 3.3 is always
available as /usr/bin/gcc-3.3, GCC 3.1 is always available as
/usr/bin/gcc-3.1 and /usr/bin/gcc3, and GCC 2 is always available as
/usr/bin/gcc2. In addition, there are symbolic links at /usr/bin/cc
and /usr/bin/gcc that point to the selected compiler. By default, the
selected compiler is GCC 3.3.</p>

<p>
However, if you have a lot of make files and shell scripts that refer
to /usr/bin/cc or /usr/bin/gcc, changing all those references to your
compiler of choice may be impractical. In that case, use the
gcc_select command to change the selected compiler.
</p>
<p>
To use GCC 2 as the selected compiler:
</p>
<UL>
<li>Open the Terminal, and enter sudo /usr/sbin/gcc_select 2.  If
you're asked, enter your password.</li>
<li> This command line logs in as root, makes the neccesary changes,
and leaves you logged in under your original account. When it's done,
/usr/bin/cc and /usr/bin/gcc use GCC 2. </li>
</UL>
<p>
To use GCC 3.1 as the selected compiler:
</p>
<UL>
<li>Open the Terminal, and enter <tt>sudo /usr/sbin/gcc_select
3.1</tt> or <tt>sudo /usr/sbin/gcc_select 3</tt>.  If you're asked,
enter your password.</li>
<li> This command line logs in as root, makes the neccesary changes,
and leaves you logged in under your original account. When it's done,
/usr/bin/cc and /usr/bin/gcc use GCC 3.1. </li>
</UL>
<p>
To use GCC 3.3 as the selected compiler:
</p>
<UL>
<li>Open the Terminal, and enter <tt>sudo /usr/sbin/gcc_select
3.3</tt>.  If you're asked, enter your password.</li>
<li> This command line logs in as root, makes the neccesary changes,
and leaves you logged in under your original account. When it's done,
/usr/bin/cc and /usr/bin/gcc use GCC 3.3. </li>
</UL>
<p>
To see which compiler version you are using, enter <tt>gcc
-v</tt>. For more help on gcc_select, enter <tt>/usr/sbin/gcc_select
-h.</tt></p> 
<p>

<H3>Switching between compilers in Xcode</H3>

<p>
To set the compiler for your target for a classic (Jambase) target,
double-click on the target in the project window to open it in an
editor.  Choose Settings -> Simple View -> GCC Compiler Settings.
Select the compiler with which you wish to build the target using the
<b>Compiler version</b> popup.
</p>

<p>
To set the compiler for your target for a native target, bring up the
inspector for the target.  Select the <b>Build Rules</b> tab.  If the
compiler shown in the System C Rule is not the desired compiler, then
add a new build rule by clicking on the <b>+</b> button.  Configure
your new build rule to process "C source files" using the desired
version of GCC.  If you wish to revert to using the system compiler,
you can delete the build rule.
</p>

<H2>Documentation</H2>

<p>
Documentation for the 3.3 compiler is available in <a
href="file:///Developer/Documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.3/gcc/index.html">/Developer/Documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.3</a>.  Documentation for the 3.1 compiler is available in <a
href="file:///Developer/Documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.1/gcc/index.html">/Developer/Documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.1</a>.</p>

<H2>Compiler option compatibility issues</H2>

<UL>
<li> The compiler now checks that an option is valid for the current
language, and warns if an invalid option is passed.  For instance,
<tt>-frtti</tt>, an option that only makes sense for C++, is no longer
silently accepted by the C compiler.</li>

<li>The <tt>-traditional-cpp</tt> option has changed.  In Apple
GCC 3.1 and earlier Apple GCC compilers, <tt>-traditional-cpp</tt> was
used to toggle between the standard GNU GCC preprocessor and Apple's
own preprocessor, "cpp-precomp".  The GNU GCC compiler
interpreted <tt>-traditional-cpp</tt> differently on all other platforms.
Since cpp-precomp has been removed for Apple's GCC 3.3 compiler, the
standard GNU meaning of <tt>-traditional-cpp</tt> has been restored.
By default, the GCC 3.3 preprocessor conforms to the ISO C standard.
Using the <tt>-tradtional-cpp</tt> option means the C preprocessor
should instead try to emulate the old "K&amp;R C".
</li>

<li>The <tt>-nostdinc</tt> option directs the compiler not to search
for header files in the standard system directories. In previous
compiler releases the implementation of this option was incomplete,
and the compiler would still search for header files in standard
umbrella frameworks. This bug has been fixed in the GCC 3.3
compiler: <tt>-nostdinc</tt> now removes <i>all</i> standard
directories from the header search path, as it is supposed to.
</li>

<li> The Apple build number is now output with the --version option,
and the format of the -v output has changed.  The --version output is
intended to be machine-parseable.</li>

</UL>

<H2>Source code compatibility issues</H2>

<p>Some source code will need to be changed when moving to GCC 3.3 because
the new compiler adheres more closely to the rules of the relevant
language standards.  Here are some specific areas where you may notice
a difference:</p>

<UL>
<li>The C++ Standard permits in-class initialization of static const
  member variables of integer types.  Previous versions of the GCC
  compiler were more lax than that, and also allowed in-class
  initialization of static const member variables of pointer types.
  GCC 3.3 no longer permits this.  This fix is simply to move the
  initialization to the member variable's definition.</li>
<li>Taking the address of a cast, as in "&amp;(int)p" is illegal, in
  both C and C++.  The C compiler has always enforced this rule, but
  the C++ compiler used to permit taking the address of a cast.  This
  bug has now been fixed.  If you have code that takes the address of
  casts, it will have to be fixed.  The fix is simply to take the
  address and then cast the resulting pointer.</li>
<li>As required by the C++ standard, the C++ compiler now issues a
  warning when the <tt>offsetof</tt> macro is applied to a non-POD
  type.  The <tt>-Wno-invalid-offsetof</tt> compiler flag can be used
  to suppress this warning.</li>
<li>In C++, the ordinary template name lookup rules now apply to names
  from a base class template that are referred to from a derived class
  template: that is, they must explicitly be written as dependent
  names.  If a class template <tt>D&lt;T&gt;</tt> inherits from another class
  template <tt>B&lt;T&gt;</tt> then, to access names from <tt>B&lt;&gt;</tt> from within
  <tt>D&lt;&gt;</tt>, you should write <tt>"B&lt;T&gt;::x"</tt> instead of just
  <tt>"x"</tt>.  An alternative solution is for the derived class
  template <tt>D</tt> to include using-declarations of names that it
  needs to access from <tt>B</tt>.</li>
<li>GCC 3.3 now supports hexadecimal floating-point numbers, as defined
  in the C99 Standard.  There are rare constructs that may have to be
  changed as a result of this new feature: for example, GCC 3.1 interpreted
  the expression "0x5e-0x03" as a subtraction of two integer
  constants, and GCC 3.3 rejects it as a malformed hexadecimal
  floating point constant.  The simplest fix is to put spaces
  around the minus sign.</li>
<li>The GCC 3.3 preprocessor inserts a new pragma, <tt>#pragma GCC
  set_debug_pwd</tt>, as part of the new Distributed Builds
  feature. (See below.) This may surprise tools and scripts that
  depended on the exact form of preprocessed output from GCC.  These
  scripts should be rewritten to ignore unrecognized pragmas. </li>
<li>GCC 3.3 warns about nested comments when <tt>-Wall</tt> is turned
  on.</li>
<li>The GCC 3.3 preprocessor does not support the use of token pasting
  to create new invalid tokens.</li>
<li> GCC 3.3 enforces #import and #include semantics strictly compared
  to cpp-precomp.
<li>Because of the removal of cpp-precomp, the GCC 3.3 preprocessor is
  stricter and more standards compliant than cpp-precomp was.
  (Similar to the preprocessor used in 3.1 when using
  the <tt>-no-cpp-precomp</tt> flag.)
</UL>

<H2>Precompiled headers</H2>

<p>Apple's 3.3 compilers support a new form of precompiled headers.
The new form is available from Xcode; refer to the Xcode documentation
for more information.  If you're using some other build system, such
as <tt>make</tt>, see <a
href="file:///Developer/Documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.3/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html">the
procompiled header documentation</a> for information on specific
compiler options.</p>

<p>cpp-precomp is no longer supported in the GCC 3.3 compiler. GCC 3.3
ignores cpp-precomp specific options.</p>

<p>GCC 3.1's form of precompiled headers, "PFE", is no longer
supported in GCC 3.3; use the new form instead.</p>

<H2>New language features</H2>

<h3>STL debugging mode for C++</h3>

<p>By default, libstdc++ is built with efficiency in mind, and
  therefore performs little or no error checking that is not required
  by the C++ standard.  This release adds support for the <i>libstdc++
  debug mode</i>, which performs run-time checking for correct usage
  of the C++ standard library.  Incorrect usage (such as passing an
  iterator to the wrong container, or passing an invalid range to a
  generic algorithm) will result in a clear error message followed by
  an abort, rather than an unpredictable crash.</p>

<p>To enable STL debugging mode, compile your application with the
<code>-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG</code> compile flag.  Note that this flag
  changes the sizes and behavior of standard class templates such
  as <code>std::vector</code>, and therefore you can only link code
  compiled with debug mode and code compiled without debug mode if no
  instantiation of a container is passed between the two translation
  units. This does <em>not</em> mean that you are required to
  recompile your entire application: for instance, if one source file
  uses <code>std::vector</code> but <code>std::vector</code> doesn't
  occur in its public interface, that file can be recompiled in debug
  mode even if the rest of the program is not compiled in debug
  mode.</p>

<p>When it is not feasible to recompile your application, or
  when only specific containers need checking, debugging containers are
  available as GNU extensions. These debugging containers are
  functionally equivalent to the containers used in debug mode,
  e.g., <code>__gnu_debug::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> is equivalent
  to <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> in debug mode, but
  the <code>__gnu_debug</code> versions can be used in either release
  or debug mode without changing semantics.</p>

<p><i>Pedantic</i> debug mode checks not only for errors, but also
  for usages that rely on GNU extensions and that, while correct, may
  not be portable to other compilers. In pedantic mode, for example,
  constructing an <code>std::string</code> with a null pointer will
  result in an abort, not an exception.  Pedantic debug mode is not
  the default.  To enable pedantic debug mode, compile your program with
  <i>both</i> <code>-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG</code> and <code>-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC</code>. 
</p>

<p>STL debugging mode is recommended during developent or when you
  suspect an error caused by incorrect use of the C++ standard
  library.  It is not recommended for deployment builds, because it
  introduces substantial overhead.</p>

<h3>Wide character support</h3>
<p>Mac OS X 10.3 adds support for the <tt>wchar_t</tt> data type and
  for the library functions that manipulate wide strings, as required
  by the ISO C99 standard.  On Mac OS X 10.3, GCC 3.3 adds support
  for wide character manipulation in C++.  For
  example, <tt>std::wstring</tt> is now enabled.</p>

<p>Note that wide character support is unavailable on previous
  releases of Mac OS X.  Programs that are intended to be run on
  previous versions of Mac OS X should avoid <tt>wchar_t</tt> and
  <tt>wstring</tt>.
</p>

<p>Wide character support is provided for compliance with the ISO C
  and C++ standards, and for ease of porting applications from
  other operating systems.  New Mac OS X applications should instead
  use Apple's Unicode APIs, such as CFString and NSString.</p>

<h3>ObjC/ObjC++ exception and synchronization support</h3>
<p>
The Objective-C language now offers syntactic support for structured
exception handling that is similar to what is offered by C++ and
Java.  To enable the new syntax, you must pass the '-fobjc-exceptions'
options to the ObjC/ObjC++ compiler, and/or set the
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable to "10.3".</p>

<PRE>
   @try {
       ...
          @throw expr;
       ...
    }
    @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
       ...
         @throw expr;
       ...
         @throw;
       ...
     }
     @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
       ...
      }
     @catch (id allOthers) {
       ...
     }
     @finally {
       ...
     }
</PRE>
<p>
The @throw statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C program;
when used inside of a @catch block, the @throw may appear without an
argument (as show above), in which case the object caught by the
@catch will be rethrown.</p>
<p>
Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest @catch clause capable of handling objects of that type,
just as is the case in C++ and Java.  A @catch(id) clause (as shown
above) may also be provided to catch any and all Objective-C
exceptions not caught by previous @catch clauses.</p>
<p>
The @finally clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding @try-@catch section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the @try-@catch section, just as is the case in Java.</p>
<p>
There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
 Although currently designed to be binary compatible with 
 NS_HANDLER-style idioms provided by the NSException class, the new
 exceptions can only be used on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later
 systems, due to additional functionality needed in the Objective-C
 runtime.
</li>
<li>
 As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
 types other than Objective-C objects.  
 The Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with C++
 exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot throw an exception
 from Objective-C and catch it from C++, or vice versa.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The '-fobjc-exceptions' switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:
</p>
<PRE>
   ObjCClass *lockObject = ...;
   ...
   @synchronized (lockObject) {
     ...
   }
</PRE>

Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
@synchronized.  Note that throwing exceptions out of @synchronized blocks 
is allowed, and will cause the guarding object to be unlocked properly.

<h3>Inline Assembly</h3>

<p>
In addition to the traditional GCC syntax for inline assembly, Apple
GCC 3.3 now supports inline assembly using syntax as in CodeWarrior,
which allows you to write assembly instructions in function bodies the
same way as you do for assembly source files.  Both asm functions and
asm blocks within functions are available.  This feature is not turned
on by default; use <tt>-fasm-blocks</tt> to enable.
<p>
In general, the syntax and capabilities are exactly the same as what
is documented for CodeWarrior, and so the assembly code can refer to
variables and local parameters, use structure fields for offsets, and
so forth.  (The Apple GCC manual includes a short section describing
the basics of the syntax.)  However, the implementation is new, and
some bugs did not get fixed in time for this release.
<p>
1. Function names cannot be referenced in the block; they will be
interpreted as (undefined) labels, resulting in an error.  There is no
workaround.
<p>
2. Macros whose expansions include one or more instruction opcodes
will result in syntax errors.  For instance,
<pre>
#define INSN_SEQ(X,Y) \
  mr r9,X \
  mr Y,r9

asm void fn() {
  INSN_SEQ(r3,r4)
}
</pre>
should work, but fails.  This is a side-effect of the preprocessor
being integrated in 3.3; a slow but reliable workaround is to use
<tt>-save-temps</tt>.  Beware that <tt>-save-temps</tt> will leave
preprocessor output and assembly files behind, and you will need to
clean those up manually.
</p>

<H2>Compilation speed</H2>

<p>
Compilation speed in GCC 3.3 is significantly faster than it was in
GCC 3.1, particularly for C++ projects that use precompiled headers.
In addition to the general speedup, there are several special
features that are related to compilation speed.
</p>

<p>The following features are available from Xcode:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Distributed Build</i> feature makes it possible to farm
  a project build to several different machines.</li>
<li><i>ZeroLink</i> makes it possible to avoid static link during a
  development build.  This feature is particularly useful for builds
  where only a small number of files change.</li>
<li><i>Fix and Continue</i> enables some changes (particularly
  changes within a function body) while a program is still running.  
</ul>


<h3>Symbol Separation</h3>

<p><i>Symbol Separation</i> is not yet available from Xcode, but it
  is available by explictly providing command-line options to the compiler.</p>

<p>
If your project contains large headers that are included in many
different source files, Symbol Separation makes it possible to put
the debug symbols from those headers in a separate repository.  The
compiler can thus save disk space and I/O time, because it no longer
has to put the debug symbols into every object file where the headers
are included.  Symbols repositories are themselves normal object
files, and can be supplied to the linker so that the debug
information is included in the final executable.
</p>

<p>
To create the symbol repository for a header file <tt>foo.h</tt>, use
the following command:
</p>
<PRE>
    gcc-3.3 &lt;other flags&gt; -fsave-repository=<i>cinfo_dir_name</i>  foo.h  
</PRE>

<p>This command will create two files:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>foo.cinfo</tt> in the <i>cinfo_dir_name</i> directory.</li>
<li>An output file, which by default is <tt>foo.h.o</tt> in the
  current folder.  As usual, the name and location can be changed
  from the default by explicitly using the <tt>-o</tt> compiler flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To use the repository in subsequent compilations, you must provide
the <tt>-grepository</tt> command line option.  The compiler will
then search for <tt>.cinfo</tt> files in all include paths.
</p>

<H2>Major bugs fixed in this release</H2>

<UL>
<li> Type checking has been fixed and improved in many situations
involving Objective-C message dispatching and protocol lookup.</li>
<li> Type checking has been fixed and improved in many situations
involving Objective-C protocols.</li>
<li> In Objective-C when -Wselector is used, check the whole list of
selectors at the end of compilation, and emit a warning if a
@selector() is not known.</li>
<li>In C++, a number of bugs involving static member variables of
  class templates have been fixed.</li>
<li>An bug in the C++ I/O library, which involved EOF being signaled
  incorrectly and sometimes required multiple carriage returns in
  interactive input, has been fixed. (Radar 3027668, 3043108,
  3057353, 3057473, 3066494, 3068598 and many other duplicates.) </li>
<li>A C++ front end bug, which caused an internal compiler error for 
  some template friend declarations where the friend class template
  was defined in a namespace, has been fixed. (Radar 3081259) </li>
<li>The Altivec type <tt>vector bool</tt> is now being treated
  correctly as a distinct type.  In previous compiler versions it was
  being treated incorrectly as a synonym for <tt>unsigned</tt>.</li>
<li>The printf formatting macros for <tt>int32_t</tt>
  and <tt>uint32_t</tt> in <tt>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</tt> have been fixed.</li>
<li>An bug in tail recursion optimization, which sometimes
caused incorrect code generation at -O2 and above, has been
fixed. (Radar 3109864) </li>
</UL>

<H2>Optimization</H2>

<p>
GCC 3.3 has greatly improved code optimization, especially for Altivec
code. If you've turned off optimization before, particularly if you
are switching from GCC2, it's recommended that you turn it on
now. Many bugs and inefficiencies have been fixed.</p>
<p>
Xcode automatically chooses the recommended optimization
level for you. Just be sure to build with the pbxbuild tool or to
choose the Deployment build style before building your final product.</p>
<p>
For deployment builds, the recommended setting is -Os, which produces
the smallest possible binary size. Generally, a binary that's smaller
is also faster. That's because a large application spends much of its
time paging its binary code in and out of memory. The smaller the
binary, the less the application needs to page. For example, say a
binary uses aggressive function inlining. That binary saves time with
fewer function calls, but it could easily spend far more time paging
the binary code containing those inlined functions in and out of
memory.</p>
<p>
For debugging versions, the recommended optimization level is -O0.</p>
<p>
Here are the different levels for C, C++, Objective-C and
Objective-C++:</p>

<UL>
<li>No optimization (-O0). This option level is intended for
debugging; it ensures that the debugger works as you would expect. </li>
<li>Simple optimizations (-O) performs simple optimizations, including
automatic register allocation and jump threading.  This optimization
level makes a trade-off between compile speed and execution speed.
<li>More optimizations (-O2)performs all of GCC's optimizations that
don't involve a space-time trade-off. In addition to all the
optimizations for level 1, it performs common subexpression
elimination, strength reduction, and loop optimizations. It also
considers any function declared with the inline keyword for inlining.</li>
<li>Optimization for speed (-O3) performs still more optimizations. It
can be best for code that contains lots of loops and computation. In
addition to all the optimizations for level 2, it considers all
functions for inlining, even if they aren't declared with the inline
keyword.</li>
<li>Optimization for code size (-Os) produces the smallest binary
size. It performs no loop unrolling, scheduling optimizations, or
register renaming. The performance is similar to -O2.  </li>
<li><code>-fast</code>: see below.</li>
</UL>
<p>
When performing function inlining, GCC 3 inlines forward-referenced
functions in addition to the functions it inlined before. A function
is inlined if it's smaller than the inlining limit. The default limit
is 600 internal GCC instructions. To raise the limit, add
-finline-limit=number to the command line. Raising this limit too high
can slow down compiling, increase the size of your executables with
too much inlining, and lower execution speed.</p>
<p>
Here are some interesting optimizations that aren't included by -O2 or
-O3:</p> 
<p>
<b>-faltivec</b><br>
Optimizes code for Altivec.  Code built with this flag might not run
on G3 processors.
</p>
<p><b>-mtune=G3 -mtune=G4 -mtune=G5</b><br> Optimizes for speed on the
indicated chip. The default is close to G4, but produces slightly
smaller and slower code.  Code built with these flags will still run
on any processor; if you only want code that runs on one processor,
you may use <tt>-mcpu=G4</tt> and similar.
</p>
<p>
When <b>-mtune=G5</b> is used in conjunction with <b>-O3</b>, the following alignment flags should also be enabled for optimum performance:
<br>
<PRE>
    -falign-loops-max-skip=32
    -falign-jumps-max-skip=32
    -falign-loops=16
    -falign-jumps=16
    -falign-functions=32
</PRE>
</p>
<p>
<b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b><br>
Produces better code for references to static and global
data. Generally, you should use this option when building an
executable. Do not use it when building shared libraries or plug-ins
because the produced code is not valid for them.
</p>
<p>
<b>-funroll-loops</b><br>
Unrolls loops. Unrolling makes the code larger, but may make it faster
by reducing the number of branches executed.
</p>
<p>
<b>-ffast-math</b><br>
Enables some floating point optimizations that are not
IEEE754-compliant, but which usually work. Programs which require
strict IEEE compliance may not work with this option.
</p>
<p>
<b>-fstrict-aliasing</b><br>
Optimize code by making more aggressive assumptions about whether
pointers can point to the same objects as other pointers. Programs
which use pointers a lot may benefit from this, but programs that
don't strictly follow the ISO C rules about the type with which an
object may be accessed may behave unexpectedly.

<H2>Optimization using the new <code>-fast</code> flag</H2>
<p>
<code>-fast</code> changes the overall optimization strategy of GCC 3.3 in
order to produce the fastest possible running code for G4 and G5
architectures. Optimizations under <code>-fast</code> are roughly
grouped under the following categories.
</p>

<ol>

<li><p>
   <code>-fast</code> sets the optimization level to <code>-O3</code>,
   the highest level of optimization supported by GCC 3.3. If any
   other optimization level (<code>-O0</code>, <code>-O1</code>, <code>-O2</code>
   or <code>-Os</code>) is specified, it is ignored by the compiler.
</p></li>

<li><p>
   Alignment. Assume alignments for loops, functions, branches and
   structure data fields that provide fastest performance on the
   PowerPC. <code>-fast</code> sets the following alignment-specific
   options:
</p>
<pre>
   -falign-loops-max-skip=15
   -falign-jumps-max-skip=15
   -falign-loops=16
   -falign-jumps=16
   -falign-functions=16
   -malign-natural
</pre>
</li>

<li><p><code>-fast</code> enables the <tt>-ffast-math</tt> option, which
allows certain unsafe math operations for performance gains.</p></li>

 
<li><p>Strict aliasing rules.
   <code>-fast</code> allows the compiler to assume the strictest
   aliasing rules applicable to the language being compiled.
   For C and C++, this activates optimizations based on the type of
   expressions: an object of one type is assumed never
   to reside at the same address as an object of a different type,
   unless the types are almost the same. Furthermore, struct
   field references are assumed not to alias each other as long as their
   direct and indirect enclosing structure types are distinct. <code>-fast</code>
   enables the following aliasing options:</p>
<pre>
   -fstrict-aliasing
   -frelax-aliasing
   -fgcse-mem-alias 
</pre>

<p>Warning: the behavior of standard-conforming programs will not be affected by
  strict aliasing, but programs that make use of nonstandard type
  conversions may behave in unexpected ways.</p>
</li>

<li><p><code>-fast</code> enables various performance-related code
transformations. These include loop unrolling, transposing nested
loops to improve locality of array element access, conversion of
certain initialization loops to <tt>memset</tt> calls, and inline
expansion of calls to library functions such as <tt>floor</tt>. 
<tt>-fast</tt> enables the following code transformation options:
</p>
<pre>
   -funroll-loops
   -floop-transpose
   -floop-to-memset
   -finline-floor  <i>(G5 only)</i>
</pre>
<p>Some of these transformations increase code size.</p>
</li>

<li><p>
 G5 specific instruction generation. With <code>-fast</code> (unless
   <tt>-mcpu=G4</tt> is specified), GCC 3.3 generates instructions which
   are specific to G5 and result in performance gain for G5.  The
   following options are assumed for G5 under <code>-fast</code>:</p>
<pre>   
   -mcpu=G5
   -mpowerpc64
   -mpowerpc-gpopt
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>Scheduling changes. <code>-fast</code> option allows inter-block
   scheduling, and scheduling specific to the G5 architecture.  One
   such scheduling change is load after a store that partially loads what
   was stored.  The following scheduling-related options are enabled by
   <code>-fast</code>:</p>
<pre>
   -mtune=G5  <i>(unless -mtune=G4 is specified)</i>
   -fsched-interblock
   -fload-after-store 
   --param max-gcse-passes=3 
   -fno-gcse-sm 
   -fgcse-loop-depth
</pre>
</li>

<li><p>
    <code>-fast</code> enables intermodule inlining when all source
    files are placed on the same command line. The following options
    are set by <code>-fast</code> and affect such inlining:</p>
<pre>
   -funit-at-a-time 
   -fcallgraph-inlining 
   -fdisable-typechecking-for-spec
</pre>
</li>

<li><p><code>-fast</code> sets -mdynamic-no-pic by default. This allows
   for generation of non-relocatable code and is not suitable for
   shared libraries. This option may be overridden by -fPIC.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Users of <code>-fast</code> should be aware of the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because <code>-fast</code> enables highly aggressive
  optimizations, some of which may have an effect on code size or on
  program behavior, thorough testing is especially important before 
  deploying applications compiled with <code>-fast</code>.</li>
<li>For maximum run-time performance you should experiment with a
  variety of optimization options; no one set of flags is best for
  all applications.</li>
<li>In future releases of GCC, <code>-fast</code> may enable a
  different set of optimization options.  The intention behind this
  option is that <code>-fast</code> will enable optimizations that
  result in the fastest code for most applications.</li>
<li>The <code>-malign-natural</code> option incorporated in <code>-fast</code>
   results in non-ABI-conforming code, 
   which can cause problems when mixing code compiled with and without 
   <code>-fast</code>.
   In particular, some of the functions in the C++ I/O libraries
   do not currently work properly on
   MacOSX 10.3 when linked with code compiled <code>-fast</code>.  Use 
   <code>-fastf</code> (below) for C++ on MacOSX 10.3.</li>
</ul>
  
<H2>Optimization using the new <code>-fastf</code> flag</H2>
<p><code>-fastf</code> is just like <code>-fast</code> (above), except that it
   does not set <code>-malign-natural</code>.  This is useful for cases
   where the ABI incompatibilities introduced by <code>-malign-natural</code>
   cause problems.  In particular, C++ on MacOSX 10.3 should use
   <code>-fastf</code> rather than <code>-fast</code>.

<H2>How to build the compiler from source</H2>

<p>
The source code for the Apple GCC 3.3 compiler is available for download
using anonymous CVS
from <tt>:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.opensource.apple.com:/cvs/root</tt>
using password <tt>anonymous</tt> and module <tt>gcc3</tt>.  See the
<a href="file:///Developer/Documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-3.3/gcc/Source-Code.html">compiler documentation</a> for more information about how
to obtain specific compiler versions using CVS.
The <tt>opensource.apple.com</tt> repository may also contain
compilers that are more up-to-date (and less stable) than the
compiler in this release.
</p>

<p>The file <tt>README.Apple</tt>, in the top level source directory,
  explains how to build the compiler.</p>

<H2>Ways in which Apple GCC 3.3 differs from gcc on other platforms</H2>

<UL>
<li>Xcode Tools uses STABS as its debugging format, and does not support
DWARF.</li>
<li>Apple GCC 3.3 generates optimized STABS by default. That is, it
  emits debug symbols only for symbols that are actually used.  The
  "generic" FSF GCC emits debug information for all symbols,
  regardless of whether they are used.  The <tt>-gfull</tt> command
  line option directs the Apple GCC compiler to turn off STABS
  optimization and to emit debug information for all symbols, as the
  FSF GCC compiler does.</li>
<li>Apple GCC 3.3 removes empty BINCL/EINCL STABS.  This is helpful in
  improving GDB startup time. This optimization will be available in FSF 
  GCC 3.4.</li>
<li> Apple GCC's implementation of Altivec uses the older Motorola syntax, as
  described in the Altivec PIM.  The newer GNU syntax is not yet supported.
  (Programs using the GNU syntax may compile without messages, yet produce 
  unexpected results at runtime.)</li>
<li> Apple's version of GCC 3.3 supports precompiled headers (PCH).
  In the "generic" FSF GCC, precompiled headers will not appear until
  version 3.4.</li>
<li>Apple's version of GCC 3.3 supports Objective-C++.  In addition,
  Apple's Objective-C implementation contains numerous fixes and
  improvements, most notably exception and synchronization support
  (see above).</li>
<li>Apple's version of libstdc++ supports STL debugging mode (see
  above).  This feature is not yet present in the FSF version.</li>
<li>The <tt>-fast</tt> option is specific to Apple's version of GCC
  3.3.  Some of the optimizations controlled by <tt>-fast</tt> are
  not yet present in the FSF version of GCC.</li>
