>DejaGnu grew out of the internal needs of Cygnus Solutions. (then
    Cygnus Support). Cygnus maintained and enhanced a variety of free
    programs in many different environments, and we needed a testing
    tool that:</P

><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>was useful to developers while fixing
      bugs.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>automated running many tests during a software
      release process.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>was portable among a variety of host
      computers.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>supported cross-development
      testing.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>permitted testing interactive programs, like
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GDB</B
>; and </P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>permitted testing batch oriented programs, like
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GCC</B
>.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Some of the requirements proved challenging.  For example,
    interactive programs do not lend themselves very well to automated testing.
    But all the requirements are important: for instance, it is imperative to
    make sure that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GDB</B
> works as well when cross-debugging
    as it does in a native configuration. </P
><P
>Probably the greatest challenge was testing in a cross-development
    environment (which can be a real nightmare).  Most cross-development
    environments are customized by each developer.  Even when buying packaged
    boards from vendors there are many differences.  The communication
    interfaces vary from a serial line to ethernet.  DejaGnu was designed with
    a modular communication setup, so that each kind of communication can be
    added as required, and supported thereafter.  Once a communication
    procedure is coded, any test can use it.  Currently DejaGnu can use
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rsh</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>,
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tip</B
>, 
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>kermit</B
>, and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mondfe</B
> for remote 
    communications.</P
