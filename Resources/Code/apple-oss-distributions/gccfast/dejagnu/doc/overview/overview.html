CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DejaGnu</SPAN
> is a framework for
	testing other programs.  Its purpose is to provide a single
	front end for all tests. Think of it as a custom library of
	Tcl procedures crafted to support writing a test harness. A
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Test Harness</I
> is the testing
	infrastructure that is created to support a specific program
	or tool. Each program can have multiple test suites, all
	supported by a single test harness. DejaGnu is written in
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Expect</SPAN
>, which in turn uses
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Tcl</SPAN
> -- Tool command
	language. There is more information on Tcl at the <A
HREF="http://www.scriptics.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Scriptics</A
> web site, and the
	Expect web site is at <A
HREF="http://expect.nist.gov"
TARGET="_top"
>NIST</A
>.</P

>The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu
	framework make it easy to write tests for any program, with
	either batch oriented, or interactive programs.</P

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"

>DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which
	allows you to write tests that are portable to any host or
	target where a program must be tested. For instance, a test
	for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GDB</B
> can run (from any Unix
	based host) on any target architecture that DejaGnu
	supports. Currently DejaGnu runs tests on many single board
	computers, whose operating software ranges from just a boot
	monitor to a full-fledged, Unix-like realtime OS.</P

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"

>All tests have the same output format. This
	makes it easy to integrate testing into other software
	development processes. DejaGnu's output is designed to be
	parsed by other filtering script, and it is also human
	readable.</P

>Using Tcl and expect, it's easy to create wrappers
      for existing test suites. By incorporating existing tests under
      DejaGnu, it's easier to have a single set of report analyse
      programs..</P
></LI

><P
>Running tests requires two things: the testing framework, and
    the test suites themselves. Tests are usually written in
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Expect</SPAN
> using Tcl, but you can also use a
    Tcl script to run a test suite that is not based on
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Expect</SPAN
>.
    (<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>expect</SPAN
> script filenames conventionally
    use <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>.exp</I
> as a suffix; for example, the main
    implementation of the DejaGnu test driver is in the file
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>runtest.exp</SPAN
>.)</P

>Julia Menapace first coined the term ``Deja Gnu'' to describe an
    earlier testing framework at Cygnus Support she had written for
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GDB</B
>. When we replaced it with the Expect-based
    framework, it was like DejaGnu all over again... But more importantly, it
    was also named after my daughter,<A
