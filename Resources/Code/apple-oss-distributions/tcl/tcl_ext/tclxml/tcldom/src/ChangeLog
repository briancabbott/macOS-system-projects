	* tcldomPro.c: [dom::DOMImplementation destroy $node] no longer
	destroys the containing document (unless $node is the DOCUMENT node);
	now it simply removes $node from the tree.  This is compatible
	with dom::tcl (modulo memory not being freed until later).
	See SF Bugs #453741 "can't serialize after destroying a child"
	and #571174 "dom::c -- destroyNode".

2002-06-19  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>
	* tdpExpat.c: fixed DOMImplementation serialize to not
	emit duplicate <!DOCTYPE ...> declarations (see test serialize-3.3)

2002-05-09  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>
	* configure.in, Makefile.in: BUGFIX: Set CFLAGS properly 
	  to include ${SHLIB_CFLAGS}.  CFLAGS_WARNING is now included
	  in the Makefile, but is *not* included in $(CFLAGS) by default.

2002-03-14  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>
	* src/tdpExpat.c: changed [dom::element removeAttribute $node $att] 
	to match documentation -- no longer raises an error if $att is
	not currently present.

2002-02-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* A number of changes to the new toplevel Makefile and
	  configure.in to get it to compile. This fixes Bug SF #521570.

2002-02-21  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* tclDomProInt.h, tcldompro.c, tdpExpat.c:
	  TIP 27 (CONST correctness) updates.

2001-09-20  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* tdpExpat.c: Integrated (part of) patch from Pat Hoyts
	  (SF tracker ID #454214):
	  + Store CDATA sections as CDATA nodes, not text nodes. 
	  + Fix SerializeText() to escape XML special characters
	* tdpExpat.c: related bug fix in SerializeAttribute()
	* ../tests/serialization.test: updated to test the above.

2001-09-19  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* tdpExpat.c, ../tests/parse.test:
	  Implemented expat ProcessingInstruction handler.

2001-05-08  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* tcldompro.c, tdpExpat.c:
	  [dom::document createXXX] methods are now compatible
	  with dom::tcl and the TclDOM documentation.
	* NOTE: compile with -DW3C_CONSTRUCTOR_BEHAVIOR=1 to get 
	  the old (W3C DOM compliant) behavior back.
	* tdpExpat.c: 
	  Implemented SerializeProcessingInstruction(), SerializeCDATA().

2000-12-14  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure.in:
	  Miscellaneous TEA-related changes; now configures and builds 
	  on at least two different platforms.
	* configure: Added to repository.
	* tclDomProInt.h, tdp.h:
	  Removed bare carriage returns, C++ "//"-style comments.
	* tclDomProInt.h, tdpExpat.c:
	  remove unused fields infoPtr->currentByte{Index,Count} 

2000-10-07  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* livelist.c: new file.
	* tdpExpat.c, tcldompro.c:
	Pursuant to discussion on tclxml mailing list, changed
	getElementsByTagName back to returning a list variable.
	In the current implementation the result variable is "live"
	in that reading the variable will regenerate the list;
	however, write traces are still not triggered when the tree changes.

	* tclDomProInt.h, tdpExpat.c, tcldompro.c: 
	Replaced TclDomCreateNodeObj with TclDomGetNodeObj.

	* ../tests/*.test: merged in tests from Ajuba TclDomPro package.
	

2000-10-06  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>
	* tdpExpat.c: Changed getElementsByTagName to return a list
	instead of a list variable (to match the documentation and dom::tcl).
	* tdpExpat.c, tclDomProInt.h: removed 'tagnameHashTable'
	field from TclDomNode structure.
	* ../tests/*.test:
	Updated test suite so that dom::c (almost) passes.
	Principal change: in dom::c, the 'dom::document createXXX $token'
	routines don't insert the new node as a child of $token
	as they do in dom::tcl.  Tests were updated to account for this.

2000-07-31  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>

	* tcldompro.dsp:  
	* tcldompro.def:  
	* winMemDebug.c:  Removed Windows-specific memory debug routines
	    and MSVC project file.
	* tcldompro.c:
	* tdpExpat.c:  Removed thread-related stuff, as it only affected
	the Windows-specific memory debug routines.  Package should now
	be thread-oblivious as well as thread-safe.


2000-07-30  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>

	* tclDomPro.h (PACKAGE_NAME): 
	* tcldompro.c (Tcldom_Init): Changed package name to tcldom

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: Added. This might be TEA-compliant.  I can't tell.

	* tcldom.test (r1.1): Stub test suite.


2000-07-22  Joe English <jenglish@flightlab.com>

	* tclDomProInt.h:
	* tdpExpat.c:
	* tcldompro.c:
	Implemented 'dom::node children' method.
	Bugs fixed:
	    dom::node cget -firstChild and cget -lastChild
	    did not work on COMMENT nodes (and a few others)
	dom::node cget -previousSibling didn't work on TEXT_NODEs.
