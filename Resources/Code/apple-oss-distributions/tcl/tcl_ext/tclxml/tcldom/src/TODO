TO DO LIST for tcldom package, C implementation:
    30 Jul 2000:
	* locate original documentation, update it, add to package.
	  [in progress]
	* dump Windows- and thread- specific code [done]
	* integrate with Zveno TclXML package
	* test suite needs to be vastly expanded.
	  [partially done, 5 Oct 2000 -- updated dom::tcl test suite]
	  Possibly grab the original tcldompro suite?
	* cross-reference DOM spec, make sure all features are implemented
	* parse external entities
	* Possibly: redo internal data structures to improve maintainablity:
	  Instead of separate structures for different node types,
	  these can all be unified into a single node type.
	* Possibly: to save space, use TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS instead
	  of TCL_STRING_KEYS in NodeHashTable.
