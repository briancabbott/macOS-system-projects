	  stub table exported by TclDOM/libxml2.
	  (INCLUDES): Added paths to headers of libxml2, libxslt, and
	  libexslt.

	* configure.in: Added code to look for libxml2 headers and library
	  as they are used by TclXSLT too. Changed code handling the xlst,
	  exslt libraries to follow the handling in tcldom/src-libxml2
	  (Windows differentiation). Added libxml2 to link list. Added
	  code to find TclDOM/libxml2, for use of its stub table. Added
	  code to look for iconv library (windows only), as in tcldom.

	* tclxslt.c: Added CONST84 for option tables used in calls to
	  Tcl_'GetIndexFromOBj'. Gets rid of 8.4 specific warnings.
	  ! NOTE ! IMHO the code in lines 34-36 is should be in tcl.h and
	  not here.

	  (TclXSLTExtFunction): Removed bogus &.
	  Added initialization of imported stub table.

	  prefix/include, i.e. where it was installed by

	  TCL_STORAGE_CLASS.

2002-10-22  Steve Ball  <Steve.Ball@zveno.com>

	* tclxslt.c (TclXSLTExtFunction): Don't free XPath object before

	  have to be fixed later.
