		Memory Channels in Tcl
		(Version 2.2.1 / DEC-03-2004)

	Andreas Kupries	(andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net)

This directory contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl
implementing memory channels, i.e. channels storing the data
placed into them in memory, not on disk.


BACKGROUND

Tcl stands for the Tool Command Language, a freely distributable,
embeddable scripting language package.  Tk is an freely distributable X
windows interface toolkit and widget library implemented as a collection of
new commands added to Tcl.

Memchan 2.2.1 is developed for Tcl 8.0 or higher.  It is a Tcl
extension, Tk is not required.

This distribution contains the source code for Memchan + (very simple)
documentation describing the new command.
Memchan should be available by anonymous ftp from ftp.neosoft.com soon.
