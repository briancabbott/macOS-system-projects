Hello world,

We hereby announce memchan 2.2.1.

It is 
	an extension implementing several new channel-types.
	Instances store their contents in memory, not on disk.
    
Changes from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1

*	Enhanced stubs API to permit Memchan channels to be created by
	third party extensions. See memchanapi(n).

Changes from 2.2a4 to 2.2.0

*	New channels types random and zero.

*	Improved compilation support for Windows.


The distribution can be found at
