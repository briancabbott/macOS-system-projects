This is the README file for the Macintosh version of the Memchan extension


	I don't have a Mac, nor do I have access one. Because
	of this I am unable to provide a Mac port of this
	extension.  I will most happily integrate any required
	changes, makefiles, et cetera into the distribution,
	if they are send to me (a.kupries@westend.com).
