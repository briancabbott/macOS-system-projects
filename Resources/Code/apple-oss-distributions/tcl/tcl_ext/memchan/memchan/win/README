This is the README file for the Windows version of the Memchan extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please follow the instructions in the HTML file

	doc/html/memchan_cwin.html

for compilation and installation of this package.


In order to compile Memchan for Windows, you need the following items:

	Memchan 2.2a4 Source Distribution
	Tcl 7.6, 8.0* Source or binary distribution

	Either	MS Visual C++ 2.x/4.x/5.x
	or	the Cygwin GCC port (and associated tools)

In the "win" subdirectory of the source release you will find

	makefile.vc, makefile,vc5 and Makefile.gnu

These are the makefiles to use with either MS VC 4.x, 5.x or the Cygwin
environment. You should copy the appropriate file to "makefile" and then
update the paths at the top to reflect your system configuration.  Now
you can use "nmake" (MS) or ? (Cygwin) from a DOS Window to build the
extension.

For MS VC++ make sure that you added the paths (and their 'bin' sub-
directories) in the following make variables (see your Makefile) to your
PATH environment variable:

	TOOLS32, TOOLS32_rc and MS_LIBPATH
