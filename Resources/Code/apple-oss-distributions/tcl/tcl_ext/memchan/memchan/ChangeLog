2009-03-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/bugExt.c: Fixed [SF Bug 2687845] by Stuart Cassoff,
	* generic/bugFix.c: added inclusion of memchanInt.h to these
	* generic/bugRange.c: files to declare memcpy().

2008-10-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/memchanInt.h: Fixed [SF Bug 2078168] by Larry Virden
	  <lvirden@users.sourceforge.net>. Added inclusion of header
	  <string.h> to get declarations for strcmp, memcpy, and memset.

2007-11-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* teapot.txt: New file, basic meta data of the package for TEApot
	  compatible repositories.

2006-05-08  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in:      Fixed make test target.

2006-01-24  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to TEA 3.5
	* configure.in:     Ditto.
	* configure:        Regenerated.

2005-06-08  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Makefile.in: Updated the toplevel build system to TEA 3.2.
	* configure.in:
	* generic/init.c:
	* generic/memchanStubLib.c:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:

2004-11-10  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in: Fix the unix build system for the stubs
	stuff. Verified that the generated stubs lib can be used in an
	extension (make chantest target).

2004-11-10  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/memchanapi.man: NEW documentation for the stubs API functions.

	* generic/memchan.c:  Fix and test for bug #1060620 which shows a
	* tests/memchan.test: problem using fileevent on memchan channels

	* generic/fifo2.c: Added special case for attempts to build on
	threaded tcl 8.2. This version doesn't support Tcl_MutexFinalize
	and we would leak mutexes from fifo2. Provided error stub
	functions and included a #error so that anyone attempting to build
	under these conditions will know what the problem is.

	* generic/null.c:        Fix for compilation with tcl 8.2 and above.
	* generic/random.c:
	* generic/zero.c:
	* generic/memchanInt.h:

2004-11-09  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/memchan.h:          Added a stubs library for the Memchan
	* generic/memchan.decls:      extension. This exposes an API that
	* generic/memchanDecls.h:     permits C extensions to create Memchan
	* generic/memchanStubInit.c:  channels directly.
	* generic/memchanStubLib.c:
	
	* generic/chantest.c:     Sample extension for testing the stubs
	                          linking C API.
	
	* doc/manpage.css:        Added the tcllib style-sheet.

	* generic/memchan.c:      Modified in support of the stubs API. 
	* generic/fifo.c:         Each channel creation command now uses
	* generic/fifo2.c:        the C API internally. Channel creation code
	* generic/null.c:         moved to a function exposed on the Memchan
	* generic/zero.c:         stubs interface.
	* generic/random.c:
	* generic/buf.decls:
	* generic/bufStubInit.c:

	* win/makefile.vc:        Windows build files updated
	* win/rules.vc:
	* configure.in:           TEA files updated with new version.
	* configure:

	==== Incremented version to 2.2.1 ====
	
2004-08-04  Pat Thoyts  <pat@zsplat.freeserve.co.uk>

	* generic/fifo2.c: Applied fix for bug #996078 which sets the channel
	                   mutex to NULL in threaded tcl (Jeff Gilbertson)

2004-06-04  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure:        Updated and regenerated the TEA configure script
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: This now works with Msys on Windows (gcc & cl)

2004-06-04  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/zero.c:   Make the interval between fileevent
	* generic/null.c:   notifications configurable (FR #470415).
	* generic/random.c:
	* doc/zero.man:     Add the -delay option to the manual pages.
	* doc/null.man:
	* doc/random.man:
	* tests/zero.test:  Additional tests for -delay ?ms? option.
	* tests/null.test:
	* tests/random.test:

2004-06-03  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in:         Changed version to 2.2.0
	* configure:
	* DESCRIPTION:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/mc.rc:
	* unix/Makefile.in:     Updated unix/* build files for the new
	* unix/configure.in:    random and zero channels.
	* unix/configure:

	* generic/zero.c:       Added a 'zero' channel (FR #470414)
	* tests/zero.test:
	* doc/zero.man:
	* generic/init.c:
	* generic/memchanInt.h:
	* Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc
	
2004-06-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/memchan.c: Added include of <stdio.h>. This does not
	  hurt compilation against 8.4, and makes compilation against 8.5
	  possible again after its header reform. We need it to get the
	  SEEK_ constants.

2004-05-31  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/random.c: Added empty BMP. Also removed references to
	  the 'null' channel, changed them into 'random'.

	* Makefile.in: Fixed typo DOC_* => DOC_*. Caused the documentation
	  to not be installed.

2004-05-22  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in:      Added a dependency rule to document creation -
	                    fixes SF bug #681115

2004-05-22  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in:         Added random channel.
	* generic/random.c:
	* tests/random.test:
	* doc/random.man:
	* generic/init.c:
	* generic/memchanInt.h:
	* isaac/rand.h:
	* isaac/randport.c:
	* isaac/standard.h:
	

	* win/makefile.vc:   Updated the MSVC build system for use with
	* win/mc.rc:         MSVC++ 6 or 7.
	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/nmakehlp.c: 

2004-05-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/fifo2.c:   Failure in BMP is not allowed.
	* generic/fifo.c:    Seek sets the channel temp. to
	* generic/memchan.c: blocking 1.
	* generic/null.c:

2004-05-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/fifo2.c:   Gave all drivers a BlockMode proc (BMP).
	* generic/fifo.c:    This proc will reject all attempts
	* generic/memchan.c: to set -blocking 1. But the main
	* generic/null.c:    purpose is to ensure that the
	                     Tcl IO core does not believe that is
			     has to do non-blocking on its own.

2004-02-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* DESCRIPTION.txt: Updated to dinstinguish CVS from release.
	* generic/fifo.c (Input):    Fixed bug in reporting when at
	* generic/memchan.c (Input): the end of the buffer. Has to
	                             be 0/no-error, not -1/wouldblock.

2003-05-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/memchanInt.h: forcing usage of 'sprintf' for the
	  generation of the channel name across all platforms
	  now. Encountered an HP lto with a different signature than we
	  use here, causing the code to get what is essentially on the
	  stack as handle suffix, completely bogus.

2003-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to newest tcl.m4, regenerated
	  configure's.

2003-02-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/memchan.c (Seek): Fixed bug 556819. Interpretation of
	  the sign of the seek offset was wrong for seek mode SEEK_END.

2003-01-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Makefile.in:        Providing information about tclsh and its
	                      environment to nroff_gen.
	* tools/mpexpand.tcl: Copied from tcllib, portable doctools
	                      processing.
	* tools/nroff_gen:    Use mpexpand.tcl, use provided tclsh to
	                      invoke it.

2003-01-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/mpexpand: Added new tool. Linux/ix86 starpack containing a
	  doctools processor.

	* tools/nroff_regen:             Rewritten to use mpexpand for most
	* tools/manpage_regen:           conversions. The conversion to HTML
	* tools/rules/manpage.html.site: for the website still relies on the
          old expand system. Writing a good formatting engine for that,
	  even if derived from the doctools HTML engine takes more time
	  than I want to invest right now. Rewriting the rules file
	  instead. That was less work.

	* doc/fifo.man:    The original contents were written
	* doc/fifo2.man:   in a precursor format to doctools.
	* doc/memchan.man: Now rewritten to conform to the
	* doc/null.man:    doctools specification.
	* doc/random.man: 

2002-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc (MCOBJS): Updated to list all relevant object
	  files.

2002-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in: Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value to
	  the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	  squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	  +DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	  a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in ($($(PACKAGE)stub_LIB_FILE)): Fixed copy/paste
	  error. Do not use AR explicitly.
	  (MAKE_STUB_LIB): S.a.

2002-08-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* === Release 2.2a4  available ===

	* Makefile.in:
	* aclocal.m4:
	* configure.in: New, from tcl/sampleextension, modified for
	  Memchan. Essentially an update to the new TEA.

	  helpers. Straight out of tcl/sampleextension.

	* tcl.m4:
	* install-sh:
	* pkgIndex.tcl:
	* mkinstalldirs:
	* mkIndex.tcl.in: Removed. Not required by the TEA II
	  make/configure, or provided by tclconfig.

	* tea/*: Moved into toplevel directory.

	* PREPARE: Removed dependencies on external packages.

	* tools/setversion:
	* tools/svfiles: special script to hack the version information
	  and others data into a number of files, without having to rely
	  on external packages. The system remembers the full current text
	  which has to change for a new version, and the pattern from
	  which to generate the new text.

	* doc/nodes:
	* doc/manual: Removed old documentation

	* generic/memchan.c: Reverted Wide changes.

2002-04-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tea/Makefile.in (install-lib-binaries): Added a missing ;. Bug
	  was introduced by ysterdays change to install a hand-crafted
	  package index file.

	  system goes with which version of the tcl core.

2002-04-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tea/pkgIndex.tcl: New, manually generated package index.

	* tea/Makefile.in: Install the manually generated package index
	  instead of trying to use "mkIndex" to auto-generate one.

	* generic/bufQueue.c:
	* generic/buf.decls (Buf_QueueWrite): inbuf CONSTified. TIP 27 followup.

	* generic/buf.h (VECTOR): Removed __stdcall for Windows.

	* generic/bufDecls.h: Added BUILD_Memchan dependent change of
	  TCL_STORAGE_CLASS in sections not touched by "genstubs".

	* generic/bufExt.c:
	* generic/bufFix.c:
	* generic/bufRange.c: Added cast to 2nd parameter of "Buf_Create".

	* generic/init.c: Removed EXTERN from Memchan_*Init.
	* generic/memchanInt.h: Added EXTERN declarations for
	  Memchan_*Init, added definition of EWOULDBLOCK.
	
	* tea/mkIndex.tcl.in: Better handling of cygwin paths, look for
	  package without version for generation of index.

2002-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tea/Makefile.in (install-lib-binaries): Changed INSTALL_DATA to
	  INSTALL_PROGRAM to accomodate HPUX.

	* generic/null.c: 
	* generic/fifo.c:
	* generic/fifo2.c: More CONSTified API (TIP 27), Output and
	  GetOption.

2002-03-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

        * generic/memchan.c (Seek):      Added WideInt support (TIP 82).
        * generic/memchan.c (Output):    CONSTified API (TIP 27)
        * generic/memchan.c (GetOption): CONSTified API (TIP 27).

2001-11-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tea/Makefile.in (install-doc): Added invokations of `basename`
	  to keep absolute paths to the source out of the destination for
	  the copy operation.

2001-11-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tea/configure.in:

	* htdocs/raw/index.exp: Removed reference to the old site.

	* PREPARE: Added code to move the TEA makefiles to their correct
	  location in the source distribution. This code also eliminates

	* htdocs/raw/mem_event.exp: New page for the website containing
	  thoughts about generation of file events for memory
	  channels. References the new documentation about the
	  interactions in the Tcl core between I/O system and notifier.

	* tools/rules/memchan: Added declaration of additional
	  documentation page about event generation.

	* tools/rules/references: Added reference to Tcl documentation
	  about the interaction between the components of the Tcl I/O
	  system and the components of the Tcl notifier.

Fri May  5 00:19:45 2000  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/fifo2.c: Added bi-directional fifo.

Thu May  4 20:43:16 2000  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/init.c (Memchan_Init): Added the 'null' command for the
	  creation of null channels.

	* generic/null.c: New channel type, the null device.

	* generic/fifo.c: Simplified through the use of the new buffer
	  functionality.

	* generic/buf*: Worked on a new buffering system for memchan and
	  possibly the Tcl I/O system for the last few days.

Sat Jan 15 00:28:52 2000  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* tea/Makefile.in (install-lib-binaries): Fixed error in this
	  target. Mailed problem and fix to TEA mailing list.

Sat Sep 18 15:06:07 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/fifo.c (GetOption): See below, '-allocated'.

	* generic/memchan.c (MemchanCmd): Added option '-initial-size',
	  proposed by <Petteri.Kettunen@picker.fi>. If specified the
	  channel will preallocate some buffer space, making the first
	  write accesses a bit faster.
	  (GetOption): Added '-allocated' to query the size of the
	  allocated buffers, not the used number of bytes.

Tue Sep 14 00:42:11 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/memchan.c, fifo.c, counter.c: Changed to use LTOA
	  instead of 'sprintf'.

	* generic/memchanInt.h (LTOA): Added definition of LTOA macro,
	  its contents are dependent on the presence of 'ltoa'. The system
	  uses 'sprintf' as its fallback.

	* win/makefile.vc(5),.gnu, unix/configure/in, tea/configure.in:
	  Added check for 'ltoa', Windows assumes that the function is
	  present.

	* generic/memchanInt.h: Added a fix sent by Jan to enable use with
	  gcc-2.95 on Windows.

	* BUILD_memchan changed to BUILD_Memchan, adapted the header and
	  the other build directories. Have to use ./ to load the library
	  for testing. This obsoletes LD_LIBRARY_PATH and consorts.

	* Added 'tea' build directory the day before yesterday and asked
	  for problem reports (Jan, Larry). These came in yesterday.

Sun Aug  1 16:15:23 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Added binary distribution for Windows, from Jan, excluded old
 	  binary distributions (for 1.9) and added a reference to the old
 	  site for this version instead.

Tue Jul 27 22:57:56 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* doc/nodes/home.node, compile.node, win.node, mac.node,
	  unix.node: Moved doc/INSTALL to HTML. Added reference to version
	  1.9 site for people interested in usability with Tcl 7.6.

	* generic/memchan.c, counter.c, init.c, fifo.c, memchanInt.h:
	  Removed all #ifdefs relating to Tcl 7.6, support for that
	  version is no dropped.

Mon Jun 28 23:17:35 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* unix/configure.in, Makefile.in: Matt Newman <matt@novadigm.com>
	  sent in some changes to built the extension on HPUX (Basically
	  check for .sl extension too).

Sat Jun 12 23:12:26 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/makefile.vc5 (MCOBJS): See below.

	* win/makefile.vc (MCOBJS): Added 'dllEntry.obj' to the
	  definition. 

	* generic/memchanInt.h: 'DllEntryPoint' removed. See below.

	* generic/init.c: 'DllEntryPoint' removed. See below.

	* win/dllEntry.c: New file, again from Jan, to simplify DLL
	  generation for Windows. The information in it can be removed
	  from the generic parts.

Fri Jun 11 22:40:02 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/Makefile.gnu: Got from Jan <nijtmans@wxs.nl> a binary
 	  distribution for memchan, compiled with Cygwin B20.1
 	  (-mno-cygwin), and the Makefile used to do that. Assorted
	  little changes to 'mc.rc' too.

Wed May 26 00:17:18 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* tests/fifo.test: Added test suite for 'fifo's.

	* unix/pkgIndex.tcl: Added new command to the index.

	* doc/nodes/cmds.node: Added documentation for 'fifo'.

	* generic/fifo.c: New file, new channel type. Like memchan in
	  memory, but access is done fifo-like (first in/first
	  out). Seeking is not possible. Like a socket or a pipe, but in
	  memory.

Tue May 25 18:35:24 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/memchanInt.h: Made the header usable for C++ compilers.

	* unix/Makefile.in: See below.

	* win/makefile.vc(5): Added rules for new object files.

	* generic/counter.c: Moved handle generation into separate
	  file. Added usage of mutexes for thread enabled tcl to make
	  handle generation safe.

	* generic/memchan.c: Moved declarations and initialization code
	  into separate files (memchanInt.h, init.c).

	* doc/nodes/cmds.node: Added description of the provided command.

Tue May 11 22:29:18 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ---------------- Ready to release 1.8 --------------------
	
	* unix/Makefile.in, PREPARE, tests: Added testsuite to memchan.

Mon Apr 12 17:27:08 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/memchan.c: Fixed error in definition of EXPORT, as
	  reported by <Petteri.Kettunen@picker.fi>.

	* win/makefile.vc(5): Fixed some errors in the win makefiles, as
	  reported by <Petteri.Kettunen@picker.fi>.

Thu Mar 25 12:30:40 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ---------------- Ready to release 1.7 --------------------

Wed Mar 24 13:15:36 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/pkgIndex.tcl: Separate package index, no way to use one DLL
	  for all versions of tcl. Stubs no help ?

	* unix/configure.in, unix/Makefile.in: Added all necessary code to
	  detect and use stubs appropriately.

	* unix/pkgIndex.tcl.in: Added code to check package dependency on
	  tcl version, which is dependent on the usage of stubs too.

Mon Mar 22 09:57:05 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c: Started to work on the changes required by 8.1 and
	  the new stub-mechanism.

	* configure.in (TCL_LIB/INCLUDE_DIR): Added 8.0.4 and 8.0.5 to the
	  list of paths to search.

Sun Dec 20 19:54:08 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c: Changed definition of panic to allow co-existence
	  with tcl8.0.4+. Got information about problems from a
	  beta-tester of the new plus-patches.

Wed Sep 30 15:43:42 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* configure.in (TCL_LIB/INCLUDE_DIR): Added some additional
	  intelligence: Setting one of the variables, but not the other
	  causes automatic definition of the missing part with a value
	  derived from the defined directory. Suggested by Larry Virden.
	  Added 8.0.3 to the paths to search. Added $exec_prefix/lib to
	  the paths to search for the tcl-library.

Fri Jun 19 22:59:18 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* configure.in: Fixed a bug noted by David Herron
	  <davidh@crl.com>. From its mail:

	> In the section that checks for the TCL library there
	> is a loop looking for different library extensions.
	> In my case it needs to match the ".so.*" case of
	> the loop, but it doesn't.
	> 
	> Changing the test to read as follows fixes the problem.
	> 
	>    if test -f $dir/libtcl$version$libsuff; then
	>        memchan_cv_lib_TCL_LIB="-L$dir -ltcl$version"
	>        TCL_LIB_DIR="$dir"
	>    fi
	> 
	> The difference is removal of the quote marks around
	> the file name.  This allows the "*" to be evaluated
	> by the shell & find the file name.
	> 
	> Another change that would be convenient is, in
	> the 'for version in ...' part, to add "80" to
	> the list of choices.  With (at least) tcl8.0pl2
	> on FreeBSD the library is "libtcl80.so.1.0" and 
	> since the configure script only looks for "libtcl8.0"
	> it is not found again because of that.

Sat Jun 13 14:27:10 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c (channelType): Updated to reflect structure change
	  from Tcl 8.0 to Tcl 8.1.

Sun Jul  6 14:29:51 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.4 released --------
	
	* memchan.c: Updated code to reflect changes in Set/GetOption API
	  of channel drivers made by 8.0b2.

Thu May 29 11:25:56 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.3 released --------
	
	* memchan.c: Bag of changes to adapt this code to the new
	  notifier system of 8.0b1. Will now run either with 7.6 or
	  8.0b1. The decision is made at compile time.

	* PREPARE: adapted to new 'makedist' and interface.

Thu Feb 27 21:49:48 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c (Mem_safeInit): renamed to 'Memchan_SafeInit'. First
	  bug in this 1.2 Release.

	* -------------------- 1.2 released --------
	
Tue Feb 18 18:35:59 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.2 ready for release --------

Mon Feb 17 17:47:22 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c: added prototypes missed by MSVC++.

Sat Feb 15 20:09:58 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c: integrated changes required to compile cleanly on
	  windows. 

	* INSTALL: updated to contain info for compilation on Windows as
	  well. 

	* Added 'makefile.vc' for compilation on Windows. The required
	  'pkgIndex.win' is generated by 'PREPARE' from 'pkgIndex.tcl.in'.

	* Rewrote generation of distribution (PREPARE, make-tape).
	  'DESCRIPTION' now central point for version information. The
	  data obtained from it is placed into all relevant files at
	  distribution time (README, LSM, ...),

	  Note: 'PREPARE' is an file internal to the package. It contains
	  tcl-code preparing the package for distribution (removing
	  unofficial and/or internal files, manpage generation, ...). It
	  is not part of the distribution however.

Mon Jan 13 22:21:48 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* INSTALL: updated to reflect new search order and versions.

	* Makefile.in: Removed now superfluous variables.

	* configure.in: don't use -lsocket, -lm. Why there they included
	  anyway ?

	* configure.in (line 259): don't bother with -ltclX.Y if not
	  running under AIX.

	* configure.in: lowest possible tcl version is 7.6, not 7.5. Added
	  recognition of 8.0 versions.

	* configure.in: changed search order: sibling directories before
	  <prefix> paths. But commandline options overide all.

Thu Dec  5 19:02:06 1996  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* PREPARE: updated to exclude the new directories (see below) from
	  distribution.

	* added internal directories 'patches' and 'mails'.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): adapted to last change, done by patch,
	  see below.

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: former pkgIndex.in, renamed by patch, see below.

	* Makefile.in (LIB_RUNTIME_DIR): added by patch, see below.

	* got a patch from Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@nici.kun.nl>.

Fri Nov 15 22:45:04 1996  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* Extracted memory channel code from trans-patch and made it a
	  separate library.
