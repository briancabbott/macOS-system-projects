Hi,

I found a bug in the configure script in memchan1.3.
In the section that checks for the TCL library there
is a loop looking for different library extensions.
In my case it needs to match the ".so.*" case of
the loop, but it doesn't.

Changing the test to read as follows fixes the problem.

                if test -f $dir/libtcl$version$libsuff; then
                    memchan_cv_lib_TCL_LIB="-L$dir -ltcl$version"
                    TCL_LIB_DIR="$dir"
                fi

The difference is removal of the quote marks around
the file name.  This allows the "*" to be evaluated
by the shell & find the file name.

Another change that would be convenient is, in
the 'for version in ...' part, to add "80" to
the list of choices.  With (at least) tcl8.0pl2
on FreeBSD the library is "libtcl80.so.1.0" and 
since the configure script only looks for "libtcl8.0"
it is not found again because of that.

Thank you for providing this software ...

	David
