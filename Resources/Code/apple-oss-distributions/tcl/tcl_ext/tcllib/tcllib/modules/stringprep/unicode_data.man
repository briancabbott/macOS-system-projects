[para]

The [package unicode::data] package is a helper for
[package unicode], providing it with the data tables needed to
perform its functions. It is an [emph internal] package which should
not be accessed on its own. Because of that it has no publicly
documented API either. Its implementation is generated by a script.


[section {BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK}]

This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain
bugs and other problems.

Please report such in the category [emph stringprep] of the
[uri {http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883} {Tcllib SF Trackers}].

Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either
package and/or documentation.
