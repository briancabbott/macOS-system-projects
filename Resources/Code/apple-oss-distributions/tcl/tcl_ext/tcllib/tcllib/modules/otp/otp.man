[description]
[para]

This package is an implementation in Tcl of the One-Time Password
system as described in RFC 2289 (1). This system uses message-digest
algorithms to sequentially hash a passphrase to create single-use
passwords. The resulting data is then provided to the user as either
hexadecimal digits or encoded using a dictionary of 2048 words. This
system is used by OpenBSD for secure login and can be used as a SASL
mechanism for authenticating users.

[para]

In this implementation we provide support for four algorithms that are
included in the tcllib distribution: MD5 (2), MD4 (3), RIPE-MD160 (4) 
and SHA-1 (5).
