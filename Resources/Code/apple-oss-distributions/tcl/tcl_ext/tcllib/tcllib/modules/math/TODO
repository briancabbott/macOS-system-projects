optimize.tcl: linear programming algorithm ignores certain

              fixed

interpolate.man: add examples
interpolate.tcl: more consistency in the calling convention
                 checks on arguments (add tests for them)
optimize.man: example of a parametrized function (also a test case!)
optimize.tcl: provide an alternative for maximum
