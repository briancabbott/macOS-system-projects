    sak note module package tag...

    	This command saves tags for use by 'sak readme'.
	The single tag '---' shows that the package is unchanged.
	The tags 'D' and 'T', alone or in combination show that
	the package is changed, but not in a visible way.

	This is a support command for the release manager.
