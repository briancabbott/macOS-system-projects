Tclresource 1.1.1


This is the Tclresource extension implementing the [resource] command in
Tcl. System MacOSX 10.2 or greater is required. This extension is only
useful on Macintosh OSX platforms.

The Tclresource1.1 folder should be installed on your system in
/Library/Tcl or ~/Library/Tcl or any folder contained in your auto_path
variable. If you use it with AlphaX (version 8.0b11 or greater), you can
also install it in the Tclextensions folder at the same level as the
application and it will be loaded automatically by AlphaX at startup.

Please read the documentation about the command in the Help file TclResourceHelp.html

To load the extension in a Tcl script, just use the following instruction:

        package require resource
