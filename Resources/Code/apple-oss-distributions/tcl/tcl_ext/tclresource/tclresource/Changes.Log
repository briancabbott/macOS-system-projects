Changes Log for the Tclresource extension
=========================================

The [resource] command was originally defined as a built-in command of Tcl on
MacOS 7/8/9. The original code can be found in the old Tcl sources in
/tcl/mac/tclMacResource.c. The Tclresource extension is backwards compatible
with the original command. Version 1.0 can be considered strictly as a port of
this command to OSX (with minor modifications reflecting OSX idiosyncrasies: no
ROM resource map etc.). Higher versions (1.1 and greater) widely enhance the
syntax of the [resource] command but will always remain backwards compatible
with the original command.

This is an Open Source project. The source code for this extension can be 
found on the SourceForge site at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tclresource>

Tclresource binary releases are available at
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93101>

You can browse the cvs repository online at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tclresource>
