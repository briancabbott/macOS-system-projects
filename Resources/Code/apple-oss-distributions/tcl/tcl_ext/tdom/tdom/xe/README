XE needs saves the upper input window in the file ~/.xe-input, if
it is called without arguments. Otherwise the first argument
gives the file name for the saved input windos.

To start playing with XE copy you could do either:

 1)  cp xe-input ~/.xe-input
     xe

 2)  xe xe-input


Latter should be more appropiate for Wn32 users.
