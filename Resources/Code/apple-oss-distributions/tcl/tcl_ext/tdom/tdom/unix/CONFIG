#
# This is a small collection of example settings you can use to
# compile tdom on different platforms. Just uncomment the line(s)
# you need and run this script with "sh CONFIG".
#
# It's best, to leave the tDOM specfic configuration options alone
# (that is: use the defaults, do nothing).
# 
# --enable-tdomalloc
# Default: off
# With this option on, a special memory allocator is used, which is
# optimized for low memory allocation overhead. This allocator works
# only on 32-bit plattforms. If you build for a 64-bit OS, you _must_
# disable this (and it's disabled by default).
# 
# --enable-dtd
# Default: on
# With this option on, the underlying XML parser expat will be build
# with parsing support of XML DTDs. Leave this option at default. If 
# you disable this option, then all the SAX handlers related to DTD
# events won't work any more. It also affects the DOM interface:
# without DTD support, the fetching of external entities with the
# -externalentitycommand won't work. With this option off, the test
# suite will report a lot of failure because of missing features.
# 
# --enable-ns
# Default: on
# With this option on, the underlying XML parser expat will be build
# with parsing support of XML namespaces. This affects only the SAX
# interface; the DOM interface always uses a non XML namespace expat
# parser behind the scene and does the XML namespace handling by
# its own.
# 
# --enable-unknown
# Default: off
# With this option on, tDOM replaces the standard unknown command with
# its own version. This allows a special shortcut syntax together with
# the deprecated XPointer methods. It's there for backward 
# compatibility reasons. It is known, that it cause trouble together
# with itcl.
# 
# --with-aolserver
# If building tDOM as module for AOLserver, this points to the 
# directory with the AOLserver source distribution. See below
# for examples.
# 
# --with-tdom
# Useful (and avaliable) only for building extensions to tDOM (as
# tnc). Use it to point to the tdomConfig.sh file.
