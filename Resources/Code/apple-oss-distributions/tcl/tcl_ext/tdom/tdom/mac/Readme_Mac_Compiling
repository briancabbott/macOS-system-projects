Readme_Mac_Compiling====================This folder contains the CodeWarrior (CW Pro8) project files to compile thetDOM and tnc extensions. These files are in  XML  format  to  ensure  theirportability. To recreate the projects,  you  must  launch  CodeWarrior  andchoose the "Import Project..." command in the File menu:- tDOM.prj.xml contains targets  to  build  tDOM  and  tnc  as  CFM  sharedlibraries (shlibs) for MacOS classic (system 8 or 9):	¥ Expat static lib	¥ tDOM stublib	¥ tDOM shlib	¥ Tnc shlib- tDOM_OSX.prj.xml contains targets to build tDOM and tnc as Mach-O dynamiclibraries (dylibs) for MacOSX:	¥ Precomp	¥ Expat Mach-O static	¥ tDOM stubs	¥ tDOM dylib	¥ Tnc dylibTo build these extensions, you need the TclStub.lib  stubs  library  comingwith Tcl 8.4 for the classic project and the  Tcl.framework  framework  forthe OSX project. You also need to have the Expat  sources  in  the  "expat"folder (http://expat.sourceforge.net/). There is a target in both  projectsto build Expat as a static library.The only thing to do, before starting the Make process, is  to  check  thatthe access paths are set correctly for your installation. All the paths arerelative: if you have a standard installation, you should just have to  setthe {TclTk} source tree to point to your Tcl/Tk  sources  folder.  This  isdone in the "Source Trees Setting Panel": there is already a {TclTk} sourcetree defined there, just let it point to the right location. Note also thatthe OSX project file has a target  to  build  a  precompiled  header:  thisprecompiled header contains a minimal set of Mac headers to work  around  aproblem due to a conflicting symbol name "Pattern" defined both in tDOM andin QuickDraw.h.Both extensions should now build out of the box  provided  you  "make"  thetargets in the order. The targets have been made interdependant anyway.You can also find already compiled binaries on my web page:<http://webperso.easyconnect.fr/bdesgraupes/tcl.html>Bernard Desgraupes<bdesgraupes@easyconnect.fr>Last modification: 2003-02-28 06:51:51
