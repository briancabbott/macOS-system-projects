--- Release 0.8.2, 15. Aug. 2007 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2007-08-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Now tcldomsh will source ~/.tcldomshrc at start up.

2007-08-05  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        In case of asXML with indentation: indent XML comments as
        well.

        Added method deleteXPathCache: basic control over the xpath
        expression cache.

        Variable references in XPath queries (at the places allowed by
        the XPath syntax) will now be resoved as Tcl variables,
        relative to the scope of the expression. Ignoring the XPath
        syntax rules at this point, any valid Tcl variable name will
        work.

2007-07-31  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Update to expat 2.0.1.

2007-07-27  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Updated to TEA 3.6.

2007-07-25  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Fix for the -externalentitycommand problems on (some) 64-bit
        plattforms.

2006-11-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Normalize case of attribute also (not only elements).

2006-08-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Updated the TEA build system to 3.5, to fix build problems
        with newer bash shells.

2005-03-18  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
        
        Added the 'selectNodesNamespace' to documents, to provide a
        global XPath prefix / namespace mapping. See the user
        documentation for details.

2005-01-07  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Improved VC++ compiler makefile. Thanks to Pat Thoyts for
        contribution.

2005-01-06  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added the methods 'transform' and 'delete' to xsltCmds.
    
2004-09-21  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added the '-namespaces' option to the selectNodes
        method. Not resolved namespace prefixes within the xpath
        expression now raises an error.
        *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2004-08-20  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.pointsman.de>

        Update to expat 1.95.8.        

2004-08-19  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Made tDOM work out of the box on 64-bit systems like Itanium 2
        (again) (though --disable-tdomalloc configure option at build
        time is still needed).

--- Release 0.8.0, 11. Aug. 2004 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2004-07-27  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.pointsman.de>

        New method createDocumentNode.

        Added methods nodeType, getElementById, firstChild, lastChild,
        appendChild, removeChild, hasChildNodes, childNodes,
        ownerDocument, insertBefore, replaceChild, appendFromList,
        appendXML, selectNodes, baseURI, appendFromScript and
        insertBeforeFromScript to dom docs. Beside other things, this
        allows much easier handling of top level nodes. The result
        tree may not be an XML document, but a general parsed entity.

        New (experimental) method setObjectCommands.

2004-05-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
 
        Added isPIName, isComment, isCDATA and isPIValue method to the
        dom command. Created new global (thread wide) flags for name
        and value checks (Names and FQ Names (element, attribute and
        processing instruction names), text nodes, comments, CDATA
        sections and processing instruction values). New methods
        setNameCheck and setTextCheck to control this flags.

2003-12-17  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added baseURI method, which returns the current base URI and
        has an optional argument to set the base URI. (The getBaseURI
        is deprecated.)

2003-12-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Bug fix: Don't quash white space of non white space only
        content in trim mode.

2003-11-24  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added domDoc methods omit-xml-declaration, indent, standalone,
        encoding and mediaType.

2003-10-23  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Update to expat 1.95.7.

2003-10-10  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added method normalize to domNode and domDoc commands.
    
2003-10-07  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added method insertBeforeFromScript to domNode commands.

2003-10-04  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added method asText to domDoc and domNode commands.

2003-09-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Enhanced insertBefore method: If the refNode argument of that
        method is the empty string, the newNode argument will be
        inserted at the end of the list of children of the node.
    
2003-09-17  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added the up to now missing implementation of expatObj method
        cget. Thanks goes to Harry Moreau for his contribution.

2003-04-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added domDoc method toXSLTcmd, which converts the domDoc to an
        XSLTcmd. This has no advantage over the current method in
        one-shot cases (transformation of one XML document) but
        improves the speed of batch processing of several XML
        documents or server applications. The implementation was
        already included in the 0.7.7 release, only the documentation
        was not included in that release.

        Added option -paramentityparsing to the dom parse method.        

--- Release 0.7.7, 25. Mar. 2003 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

--- Release 0.7.6, 24. Mar. 2003 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2003-03-19  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added option -useForeignDTD to dom parse and expat. Added
        domNode method 'precedes', to compare the relative order of
        two nodes out of the same document.

2003-02-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added posteriori (DOM) validation capabilities. See the tnc
        man page for details.

2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Update to expat 1.95.6.    

2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Added 'systemId' and 'publicId' methods to the domDoc
        commands. Added flag -doctypeDeclaration to the asXML and
        asHTML methods of the domDoc commands.     

2003-01-29  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Changed the escaping while serializing XML data: in the past
        """ and "'" was escaped, now it isn't anymore. There isn't a
        clear rule (to the best of my knowledge) in any of the related
        specs about this, but now we do things almost along the lines,
        as saxon (which I regard as the currently most 'rule-setting'
        xslt processor) does it. In theory (from an XML viewpoint)
        this should not make a difference, but if somebody postprocess
        some tDOM output with other tools, there is a small risk, that
        things (slightly) breaks, therefor:
        *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2002-12-28  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        The xslt method now understands also the options
          -ignoreUndeclaredParameters and -xsltmessagecmd.

--- Release 0.7.5, 27. Nov. 2002 --- See ChangeLog for details ---

2002-10-01  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	The library file lib/tdomhtml.tcl is now moved to a separate
	package in "extensions" directory. This is a simple, yet very
	"clever" HTML generator, using advanced tdom HTML capabilities.
 	To use, please change to "extensions/tdomhtml" directory and 
	invoke "configure" followed by "make", followed by "make install".
        Be sure, however, to build and install the tdom package first.
