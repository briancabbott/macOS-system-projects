<H1>Cheater's Guide to Writing AppleEvent Descriptors</H1>

<HR>

I pursue a variety of routes to figure out the codes for AEs, but in this case, I snooped on Script Editor sending

<pre>
     <b>tell</b> application "Finder" <b>to get</b> disks
</pre>

To snoop, I launch Script Editor from Terminal.app like this:

<pre>
    [dogbert:~] guyer% setenv AEDebug 1
    [dogbert:~] guyer% setenv AEDebugSends 1
    [dogbert:~] guyer% setenv AEDebugReceives 1
    [dogbert:~] guyer% /Applications/AppleScript/Script\ Editor.app/Contents/MacOS/Script\ Editor
</pre>

After executing the script, a bunch of garbage will stream by in Terminal.app, and toward the end you'll see:

<pre>
    AE2000 (28217): Sending an event:
    ------oo start of event oo------
    { 1 } 'aevt':  core/getd (ppc ){
              return id: 1849229319 (0x6e390007)
         transaction id: 0 (0x0)
      interaction level: 64 (0x40)
         reply required: 1 (0x1)
                 remote: 0 (0x0)
      target:
        { 2 } 'psn ':  8 bytes {
          { 0x0, 0x900001 } (Finder)
        }
      optional attributes:
        { 1 } 'reco':  - 1 items {
          key 'csig' - 
            { 1 } 'magn':  4 bytes {
              65536l (0x10000)
            }
        }

      event data:
        { 1 } 'aevt':  - 1 items {
          key '----' - 
            { 1 } 'obj ':  - 4 items {
              key 'form' - 
                { 1 } 'enum':  4 bytes {
                  'indx'
                }
              key 'want' - 
                { 1 } 'type':  4 bytes {
                  'cdis'
                }
              key 'seld' - 
                { 1 } 'abso':  4 bytes {
                  'all '
                }
              key 'from' - 
                { -1 } 'null':  null descriptor
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

I've been doing this for awhile, so I know to ignore most of it. The 
corresponding TclAE call is

<pre>
    tclAE::send -r 'MACS' core getd ---- {obj {form:indx, want:type(cdis), seld:abso('all '), from:'null'()}}
</pre>

<p>
Recently, Eric Williams released a little app called <a
href="http://www.oxalyn.com/aemonitor/">AE Monitor</a>. It'll snoop on AE
traffic and dump it in a variety of formats, including TclAE's (it's not
quite right, but that's my fault; I didn't have the time to test it when he
sent it to me; but the basic output should get you close).

<H2><CODE>'aete'</CODE> Resources</H2>

<P>
Even with Capture AE, it's handy to be able to read <CODE>'aete'</CODE> 
resources (if for no other reason, to decipher what you just blindly copied 
into your Tcl® statements). Resourcerer has a template to open 
<CODE>'aete'</CODE> resources and you can decompile them with Rez. If you 
can manage to find it, Yuji Hachiya of Apple Japan wrote an 
<CODE>'aete'</CODE> editor for ResEdit. It would appear, though, that Apple 
has hired the Mossad to hunt down and destroy every copy of this utility 
(IÕve seen complaints about it, but it's perfectly adequate for 
<EM>reading</EM> <CODE>'aete'</CODE> resources).
</P>

<P>
Although this probably seems like a lot of work, I assure you that 
it's far preferable to the hunt-and-peck alternative. There's no 
reason that this methodology won't work with other scriptable 
applications, either, but I take no responsibility for the implosion 
of your monitor.
