----------------- Released 1.3, 10/1/98 -----------------------

10/1/98 (new feature) AIFF file support, although there seems to be lots of
files out there that don't adhere to the specification.

10/1/98 (new feature) Sound objects now can be linked to disk files and
streams (Tcl channels) as well as having their audio data in memory.

10/5/98 (new feature) Added -byteOrder option to the sound data command and to all commands taking the -byteswap option, which is deprecated.

10/7/98 (bug fix) Fixed problem playing zero-length sounds on HP-UX.

10/7/98 (bug fix) Fixed problem playing multi-channel disk files.

10/26/98 (new feature) Makefile now also builds a Tcl only libsound.so

10/28/98 (new feature) Split OSound.c into jkSound*.c and added Snack_AddSoundCmd() for Snack extensions. Added pause command.

10/30/98 (bug fix) StopSound() now only called if the format of the sound samples change while a sound is playing, as a result of read or copy, e.g.

11/3/98 (bug fix) Fixed bug in destroyCmd() and flushCmd() causing unwanted closing of audio device.

11/6/98 (bug fix) Fixed bug in Snack_SoundCmd() for -load'ing raw files.

11/11/98 (new feature) Better validation of options -fftlen/-winlen/-channel.

1/1/99 (new feature) Made some optimizations to spectrogram drawing. Added -gridcolor option. 256-color displays now supported under Windows.

1/4/99 (new feature) Raw file input now tries to guess byte order and sample format if they weren't specified in the read/data commands.
