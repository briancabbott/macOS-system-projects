	* SOAP-CGI.tcl (::SOAP::CGI::soap_call): Fix bug in the extraction
	  of argument and handle the possibility of the methodname tag
	  having an XML namespace associated with it, reported by Giovanni
	  Varasano <giovanni.varasano@fastwebnet.it>.

	* Merged branch 'soap1_6_7_as_tdom' back into the main trunk, up
	  to and including tag 'soap1_6_7_as_tdom_complete'.

	* = TAG = soap1_6_7_as_tdom_complete

	* utils.tcl: Converted all places using TclDOM commands over to
	  tDOM. Additionally rewrote the 'getDocumentElement' accessor to
	  be iterative instead of recursive.

	* SOAP.tcl: More conversions. tDOM's XPath handling is strict,
	* SOAP-CGI.tcl: standard compliant, i.e. expects us to properly
	* SOAP-service.tcl: declare and use XML namespaces for the SOAP
	  elements. Rewrote all SOAP-specific selectNode calls. The XMLRPC
	  selectNode calls are left unchanged, as XMLRPC doesn't use
	  namespaced elements.

	* test/all.tcl: Disabled xpath.tcl and switched TclDOM over to
	  tDOM.
	
	* tests/xmlrpc.test: Rewrote the expected XML results, tDOM
	  generates a different textual layout than TlDOM when serializing
	  a DOM tree.
	
	* tests/soap.test: Fixed regexp based tests to handle the changed
	  serialized XML (different layout), and fixed one test not using
	  proper XML namespaces for the SOAP elements.

	* = TAG = soap1_6_7_as_tdom_centralized_dom_access

	* utils.tcl: Made require SOAP::xpath global to force load of the
	  dom packages.

	* tests/all.tcl: Rewritten to ensure loading of the current
	  sources for testing, instead of some TclSOAP installation.

	* tests/validator.test: Fixed direct dom access, now using
	  SOAP::Utils commands instead.

	* tests/xmlrpc.test: Fixed quotation differences in the current
	  vs. expected output.

	* SOAP-service.tcl (SOAP::Service::base64_service): Resolved the
	  remaining problemzone by rewriting the xpath invokation to a
	  selectNode node call followed by use of the new accessor
	  'getSimpleElementValue' to perform the parts of xpath call the
	  selectNode doesn't do on its own, to make the whole sequence
	  equivalent. The SOAP::xpath dependency is no more.

	* SOAP.tcl (::SOAP::insert_headers): Resolved the remaining
	  problem zone through use of the new 'documentElement' accessor
	  command.

	* utils.tcl: Created two additional accessors (documentElement,
	  getSimpleElementValue), and fixed typos in the new internal
	  'IsElement' and 'Parent' acessors.

2008-03-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* SOAP-domain.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: TclDOM accesses over to SOAP::Utils
	  commands. Moved the package to version 1.4.1. No problemzones.

	* SOAP-CGI.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: TclDOM accesses over to SOAP::Utils
	  commands. Moved the package to version 1.0.1. No problemzones.

	* XMLRPC.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all TclDOM
	* pkgIndex.tcl: accesses over to SOAP::Utils commands. Moved the
	  package to version 1.0.1. No problemzones.

	* SOAP.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all TclDOM
	* pkgIndex.tcl: accesses over to SOAP::Utils commands. Moved the
	  package to version 1.6.7.1. One problemzone remains right now:
	  The access to -documentElement in 'insert_headers', this code
	  has not been not converted yet due to not fully understanding
	  what it does.

	* SOAP-service.tcl: Removed dependency on TclDOM and changed all
	* pkgIndex.tcl: TclDOM accesses over to SOAP::Utils commands. Only
	  one problem- zone remains right now: The use of 'SOAP::xpath' in
	  'base64_service'. Moved the package to version 0.5.
	
2008-03-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* utils.tcl: Added a number of DOM accessors missing from the
	* pkgIndex.tcl: package (document construction, destruction,
	  conversion from and to XML, node/attribute creation). Light
	  internal cleanup, i.e. a number of procedures could and now do
	  use abstract dom accessors instead of using direct DOM
	  commands. Moved the package to version 1.1.
