This directory contains various samples of client SOAP and XMLRPC
methods. Of particular note are the Tcl client implementations of the
test suites in soapinterop.tcl and validator.tcl

SOAP Interoperability Labs Test Suite:
  source soapinterop.tcl
  soapinterop::validate http://tclsoap.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/rpc

XMethods Validator Suite:
  source validator1.tcl
  validate_soap http://tclsoap.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/rpc
  validate_xmlrpc http://tclsoap.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/rpc

TclHTTPD Implementation:
  Provide access from TclHTTPD to the methods implemented by the CGI
  framework. The tclserver.tcl file is an example of using the CGI
  code to export methods under this server. If this is sourced into a
  running tclhttpd instance then the /RPC URL will delegate to the
  SOAP::CGI code. You can then run the validation suite as above
  against your server URL.

Async.tcl - a sample demonstrating the use of asynchronous XML-RPC
            using the O'Reilly Meerkat service.

cgi-clients.tcl - some client methods for the urn:tclsoap:Test methods
                  provided in the cgi-bin/soap directory.
