# Map XML-RPC class name (that is the portion of a method name before the
# dot ie: `tclsoap.square' gives a class name of `tclsoap' and a method name
# of `square'
#
# Each line defines information for one class name. The format is
# `classname' `filename' `interpname'
# where each name is separated by whitespace.
# `filename' is the name of the implementation file to source
# `interpname' is the optional name of a safe interpreter to use
#
# If an interpreter name is provided then the implementation will be sourced
# into a safe interpreter with this name.
