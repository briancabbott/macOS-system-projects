#
# This file maps SOAPAction values to Tcl implementations.
#
# If the CGI package receives a SOAPAction header with a non-empty value
# it will load this map and try to identify a corresponding filename. This
# file is then sourced from the SOAP::CGI::soapdir directory.
# If the SOAPAction is not present or is empty then _all_ the scripts in the
# soapdir directory are sourced before handling the request.
#
# Comments and blank lines are ignored.

# The file format is:
# `SOAPAction' `filename' `interpreter'
# Where `filename' is relative to the SOAP::CGI::soapdir value and is the
# tcl script file that implements this Action.
# `interpreter' is the optional name of a safe slave interpreter to use
# when evaluating the script. The default empty value causes the script to 
# be evaluated in the main interpreter.

# TclSOAP sample implementations.

# This entry returns an empty value for /cgi-bin/rpc. This is quite
# frequently used as the SOAPAction instead of "" or nothing and is the
# CGI script path. Mapping to an empty value causes the CGI framework to
# treat this value as if "" was provided.
