Announcing a SOAP and XML-RPC binding for Tcl 8.3              -*- text -*-

TclSOAP is a Tcl binding to SOAP and XML-RPC remote procedure calls. Client
RPC calls are used just like Tcl internal procedures and Tcl procedures can
be exported via HTTP using the SOAP::CGI package. For instance,
the XMethods getTemp method can be called from Tcl using:

% set temp [getTemp 90810]
41.0

The Tcl SOAP package is written entirely in Tcl and depends upon the
TclDOM package written by Steve Ball of www.zveno.com.

For more information go to 
   http://tclsoap.sourceforge.net/
and the package is at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tclsoap
or you can examine the CVS repository at
  http://cvs.tclsoap.sourceforge.net/tclsoap/cvsroot

This Tcl SOAP package has been tested with Tcl 8.3 on Linux, OpenBSD and
Windows (98 and 2000) using TclXML 1.2 and TclDOM 1.6 and TclXML 2.0 and 
TclDOM 2.0.
