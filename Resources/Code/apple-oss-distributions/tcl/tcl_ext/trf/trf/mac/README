		Tcl Data transformations (Tcl-Trf)
		(Version 2.1.4 / MAY-06-2009)

This is the README file for the Macintosh version of the Tcl-Trf package.


	I don't have a Mac, nor do I have access one. Because
	of this I am unable to provide a Mac port of this
	extension.  I will most happily integrate any required
	changes, makefiles, et cetera into the distribution,
	if they are send to me (a.kupries@westend.com).
