		Andreas Kupries	(andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net)

This directory contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl/Tk called Tcl
Data transformations (Tcl-Trf). The collection of provided transformation
procedures includes:

*	Generation of message digests (hash values, checksums)

	MD2, MD5, SHA/SHS, SHA-1, HAVAL, RIPEMD-128, -160
	CRC (polynomial used by PGP)
	ADLER (based upon zlib)

*	Conversion from and to various data encodings:

	dual, octal, hexadecimal representation	
	uuencoding, base64-encoding, ASCII85-encoding

*	A reed-solomon error correcting coder.

*	(De)Compression based on zlib 1.0.4 or higher (1.1.3 is current)
	(if available as shared library)

*	Data encryption:

	Was removed from the base package, but is available
	separately (TrfCrypt).


Example applications distributed with the package are:

*	'tools/md', a message digest generator.
	Upwardly compatible to 'md5sum'.

Tcl-Trf is developed for Tcl 7.6 or higher.  It is a pure Tcl extension,
Tk is not required.  The extension requires a patched core. Patch files
for 7.6, 8.0 and 8.0a2 are part of the distribution.  The plus-patches
maintained by Jan Nijtmans (nijtmans@nici.kun.nl) contain this patch too .

Supporting (optional) packages are:

*	memchan 1.0  or higher (required by testsuite, by same author)

	See	http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/memchan/

*	zlib-1.0.4   or higher (1.1.3 is current!)

	See	http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/

*	SSLeay or OpenSSL

	See	http://www.ssleay.org/
	or	http://www.openssl.org/

Packages built upon the fundament provided by Trf are

*	TrfCrypt, contains various encryption systems, by myself.

	See	http://www.oche.de/~akupries/soft/trfcrypt/

*	TLS, an SSL/TLS implementation for all valid Tcl channels,

This distribution contains the source code for Tcl-Trf + documentation
describing commands (-> latex) and c-level interfaces (-> man-pages).
