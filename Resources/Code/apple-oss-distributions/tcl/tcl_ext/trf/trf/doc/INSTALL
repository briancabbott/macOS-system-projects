Installation and compilation instructions
with regard to the Trf extension to TCL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o	This extension requires a patched tcl, version 7.6 or higher.
	Please look in the 'patches' subdirectory for the appropriate
	patch-files.  A tcl-installation with integrated plus-patches
	doesn't need the patch, its part of these too.

	Warning: My patches were added to the plus-patches for 7.6
	some time later. Please check that you have the youngest
	available one.

	The basic patch has to be applied in the subdirectory 'generic',
	the one with extension '.byteorder' in the tcl main directory
	(the one above 'generic' et.al.)

	Please note: The tests socket-7.3, iocmd-9.5, -9.6 and -9.7 will
	fail. This is due to the new channel option '-byteorder'. The
	generated tclsh/wish is perfectly ok nevertheless. I changed the
	core, but did not adapt the tests.


o	Some functionality of this package depends on the external
	packages 'zlib' and 'libdes'. If you don't have them, the
	commands 'zip', 'adler', 'crc-zlib' and 'des' will not be
	available. More precise, they will fail with an error message. 

	doc/README.* are the original README-files of
	zlib-1.0.4 and libdes-3.23. They contain pointers
	to the distributions.

	Please read doc/INSTALL.optional before their installation.


o	That you are reading this text means, that you extracted
	the gzipped tar-archive in a directory of your choice.
	This operation should have created a subdirectory with
	the name 'trf<version>'.  It is refered to as
	"source-directory" from now on.


o	'cd' into the source-directory, e.g. make it your working
	directory, then start the automatic setup by typing
	'configure'.  If your system does not understand the
	'#!' notation of specifying script-interpreters, you
	have to type 'sh configure' (or '/bin/sh configure', ...).

	See 'INSTALL.configure' for more information about
	'configure' (it is the unchanged file 'INSTALL' as part
	of the 'autoconf' package).


o	The configure script searches for tcl.h in the following
	places:

	-1	$(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR)
	-2	../tcl8.0/generic
	-3	../tcl8.0b*/generic
	-4	../tcl8.0a*/generic
	-5	../tcl7.6/generic
	-6	../tcl/generic
	-7	../tcl
	-8	$(prefix)
	-9	/usr/local/include
	-10	/usr/include

	By default $(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR) is empty and $(prefix) points
	to the location of an installed 'tclsh' or is /usr/local if
	tclsh could not be found via $PATH.

	Use the following options to overide the defaults:

		--prefix=DIR		   -> $(prefix)=DIR
		--with-tcl=DIR		   -> $(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR)=DIR/include
		--with-tcl-include-dir=DIR -> $(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR)=DIR


o	To find libtcl.a (libtcl.so.??) the paths

	-1	$(TCL_LIB_DIR)
	-2	../tcl8.0/unix
	-3	../tcl8.0b*/unix
	-4	../tcl8.0a*/unix
	-5	../tcl7.6/unix
	-6	../tcl/unix
	-7	../tcl
	-8	$(exec_prefix)
	-9	/usr/local/include
	-10	/usr/include

	are searched. $(TCL_LIB_DIR) is empty by default, but
	can be set via --with-tcl or --with-tcl-lib-dir.

		--with-tcl=DIR		-> $(TCL_LIB_DIR)=DIR/lib
		--with-tcl-lib-dir=DIR	-> $(TCL_LIB_DIR)=DIR

	$(exec_prefix) contains the same value as $(prefix) by
	default, but can be set explicitly via --exec-prefix


o	Another notable configure option is --enable-shared whose
	appearance commands the script to configure the Makefile
	for creation of shared libraries (as required for dynamic
	loading).


o	Now start the compilation by typing 'make'.
	The makefile will then check number and names of the files
	in the package, generate dependency information, compile
	them and at last build the library.

	The tool 'get-manifest' used during file check requires
	the directory /tmp.


o	To check the extension, type 'make test' or 'make check'.
	This will build a tclsh containing just tcl and trf and
	then runs some test-scripts checking the behaviour of the
	created library.


o	At last type 'make install' to install the generated library
	and the exported header. This installation conforms to the
	rules set by the package loader mechanism of the tcl-core. 


o	To install a tclsh containing just tcl and trf please type
	'make install-bin'.  With the advent of dynamic loading this
	should not be necessary anymore.
