Defines used during the compilation of Trf to guide the process.
================================================================

ENABLE_BINIO	(init.c, binio.c)
	If set enables the compilation of the 'binio' command.
	This command is deprecated, use 'binary' instead, which
	is the official way.

	Default:	Not set.


BZLIB_STATIC_BUILD	(bz2lib.c)
	If set the code will assume that the 'bzip2'-library is
	linked statically into the trf library. If not set the
	code will try to locate and load the library dynamically,
	on demand.

	Default:	Not set.


BZ2_LIB_NAME		(bz2lib.c)
	Defines the name of the 'bzip2'-library. Relevant only
	if BZLIB_STATIC_BUILD is *not* set.

	Default (Win):	"libbz2.dll"
		Impossible to overide from the Makefile!

	Default:	"libbz2.so"
		The Makefile can overide this definition.


ZLIB_STATIC_BUILD	(zlib.c)
	See BZLIB_STATIC_BUILD, this time for 'zlib'.

	Default:	Not set.


Z_LIB_NAME		(zlib.c)
	See BZ2_LIB_NAME, this time for 'zlib'.

	Default (Win):	"zlib.dll"
		Impossible to overide from the Makefile!

	Default:	"libz.so"
		The Makefile can overide this definition.

MD5_STATIC_BUILD
	See foo_LIB_NAME, this time for 'MD5'.

	Default:	Not set.


SSL_LIB_NAME	(loadman.c)
	Trf searches for the SSL-library to get at some the
	hash functionality (md2, ...). This definition specifies
	the name of the library we are looking for.

	Default (Win):	"crypto32.dll"
	Default:	"libcrypto.so"
		The defaults can be overidden from the Makefile.


CRYPT_LIB_NAME	(loadman.c)
	The name of the library containing MD5. This value is
	usually set by 'configure' depending on the existence
	of -lcrypt and the functionality it contains.

	Default (Win):	"crypt.dll"
	Default:	"libcrypt.so"
		The defaults can and usually will be overidden
		from the Makefile, via 'configure'.

WORDS_BIGENDIAN	(rmd*.c, sha.c)
	Set by the 'configure' script. If set the code assumes
	that it will run on a bigendian system.

	Defult:	None, computed by 'configure'.


USE_TCL_STUBS	(init.c, registry.c, unstack.c, trfStubLib.c)
	If set the code will use the stub-mechanism to call
	functions from the core.

	Default:	Not set if compiled against Tcl < 8.1
			Set	if compiled against Tcl >= 8.1


TCL_THREADS	(init.c)
	Lifted by 'configure' from 'tclConfig.sh'. If set Trf
	is compiled for thread-safe operation, i.e. some places
	are protected with mutexes.


TRF_DEBUG
TRF_STREAM_DEBUG
	Developer definitions. If set code is compiled into the
	extension providing extensive! logs of its operation.
	Especially TRF_STREAM_DEBUG is able to generate logs in
	the multi-megabyte range as it exactly logs the stream
	of bytes flowing throw a transformation (r and w paths).

	Default:	Not set.
