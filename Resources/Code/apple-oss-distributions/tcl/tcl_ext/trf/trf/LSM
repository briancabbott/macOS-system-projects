Title:          trf
Version:        2.1.4
Entered-date:   MAY-06-2009
Description:    A loadable extension to Tcl providing commands for data
	conversion, message digests, zlib based compression, error-correction,
	channel-based manipulation of binary data. Trf extends the language at
	the C-level with so-called ``transformer''-procedures. With the help of
	some patches (*) to the core the package is able to intercept all
	read/write operations on designated channels, thus giving it the
	ability to transform the buffer contents as desired. This allows things
	like transparent encryption, compression, charset recoding, etc. Build
	upon this framework (and as proof of concept) a collection of tcl-level
	commands was implemented. Additionally some binary data support is put
	in as well. A separate package containing encryption transformation is
	available at the same site carrying this package. (*) The patches are
	only necessary for Tcl 8.0.x and 8.1.x. Since Tcl 8.2 the Trf patch is
	an official part of the core.
