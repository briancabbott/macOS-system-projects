Hello Jan

trf 1.0a3 is nearly complete now.
I currently try to compile it on ULTRIX 4.4, cc3.0
The systems choice was 'tclLdAout.c' as dynamic loader.

Problems encountered:

	Did not include the required header	(exec/sys.h)
	=	Solved, my Makefile did not use @TCL_DEFS@, which 
		contained the necessary defines.

	Unknown symbol	'tclExecutableName'.
	=	Solved, was found somewhere in the core, added an
		extern char* tclExecutableName to the file.

	Unknown symbol	'TclLoadDictionary_Tcl' (line 158 of tclLdAout.c)
	Unresolved!
		I grepped the entire tcl tree for this symbol, but to no 
		avail. Do you have an idea what it is and how it is defined ?

Sincerely
	Andreas Kupries <aku@kisters.de>
