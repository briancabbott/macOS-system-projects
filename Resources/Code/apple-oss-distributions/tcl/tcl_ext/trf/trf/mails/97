I'll see.

Not quite. It's because my tclsh is patched slightly, see

	http://www.sunlabs.com/cgi-bin/tcl/info.4.1

and look for a Linux entry (or my name).
Maybe I should place this note into

	http://www.sunlabs.com/cgi-bin/tcl/info.4.2

as well.

Oops, added to notes

I don't know why, its parts of the distribution:

tar tvfz trf1.0a3rc.tar.gz | grep zlib =>

Hmm, not on Ultrix. configure said 'no', not installed and make depend is 
quiet, except for 'cannot open "0"'. This is caused by '-G 0' being part 
of the arglist.

:-))

Unfortunately my workload here is going up, I have to postpone 
compilation on Ultrix. My work at home will continue!

Have fun,
