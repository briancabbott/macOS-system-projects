I'm trying to unzip the file, whose md5 is also being transparently
computed:

proc openin fname {
        set file [open $fname r]
        fconfigure $file -translation binary
        set file [md5 -attach $file -mode transparent \
                -read-destination inputsum -read-type variable]
        set file [zip -attach $file -mode compress]
        return $file
}

This results in error later on, when I'm trying to read from the file:

error reading "file6": invalid argument
    while executing
"gets $Input"
    (procedure "main" line 5)
    invoked from within
"main"
    (file "crunch.tcl" line 37)

This is probably a pilot error -- I'm still learning. May be I need to
fconfigure
back? But then, the whole process crashes:
