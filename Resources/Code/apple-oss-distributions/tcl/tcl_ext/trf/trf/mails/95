Hello Jan,

thanks for both mails. I'll try them about noon today.

BTW,
I loaded the current version of trf (1.0a3), i.e. the one I am wrestling 
with, to ftp://ftp.nici.kun.nl/pub/incoming. zlib- and 
libdes-distributions too.

Known problems:
-	It contains the problematic tclLdAout.c
-	There are some 'char*' / 'unsigned char*'
	conflicts (found today on ultrix, mainly registry.c)

Special feature:
	make-targets	'zlib', 'libdes'
	These use the information from configure to build shared 
	libraries for zlib 1.0.4, libdes 3.23.

	In the light of your second mail, they probably will fail to get it 
	right on ultrix, but maybe zsymbols.c will help here too.

Sincerely
	Andreas Kupries <aku@kisters.de>
