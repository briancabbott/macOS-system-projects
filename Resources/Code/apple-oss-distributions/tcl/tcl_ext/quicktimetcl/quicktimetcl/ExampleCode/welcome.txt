Welcome to QuickTimeTcl
This text movie is downloaded directly from my web page.
Try to find a real large movie... 
...that shows the power of the -url and -loadcommand options.
They enable you to make a movie widget from a remote movie...
...and loading at asynchronously, without anything blocking.
Text, and still images, can be opened as any movie.
QuickTime takes care of everything to import it.
Tell me your opinion (and the bugs you may find).

Enjoy,     Mats
