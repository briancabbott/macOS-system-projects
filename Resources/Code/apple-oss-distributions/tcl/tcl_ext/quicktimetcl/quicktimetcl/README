README for QuickTimeTcl 3.1

QuickTimeTcl is an extension to Tcl/Tk on Mac OS X and Windows that provides 
many bindings to QuickTime from Tcl/Tk. Starting with this release, support 
for Mac OS Classic has been abandoned. 
 
Documentation:

For more documentation, see the manual pages in the 'docs' folder. These 
contain the latest information. There are also some simple tcl example code 
in the 'ExampleCode' folder that can be helpful; just source them in.

Requirements:

Tcl/Tk 8.4 (8.4.4 on Mac OS X) and QuickTime 5 or higher.

Testing:

The current version of QuickTimeTcl is developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.2 
and Windows 2000 using Tcl/Tk 8.4. 

QuickTime:

Download QuickTime from "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download", or get a 
standalone installer from (good for switching between versions or if you are 
behind a firewall) "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/support". 
You don't need the pay (Pro) version. Not even I have it and that works fine anyway. 
Many things, altough not all, you pay for can be reproduced by some coding using 
this package :-)
    
Installing:

Just run the installer on the respective platform, or:
    
Mac OS X: Make a folder QuickTimeTcl3.1 with the QuickTimeTcl.dylib and pkgIndex.tcl 
files inside, and put this folder either in /Library/Tcl/ or ~/Library/Tcl/.

Windows: put the QuickTimeTcl directory inside the lib directory of the Tcl directory, 
as:
    
	Program
	    ...
	    Tcl
		bin
		doc
		include
		lib
		    ...
		    QuickTimeTcl
			QuickTimeTcl.dll
			pkgIndex.tcl
		    ...


WebCams on Windows:

On Windows, the 'vdig' (video digitizer) component which should be the hardware 
manufacturers responsibilty is sadly lacking on most WebCams. The grabber is 
therefore only tested with an emulated 'vdig' component WinVdig from www.vdig.com (.org). 
If you never got a QuickTime 'vdig' component with your PC camera, try WinVdig. 
Note, however, that this is only a second best solution.    

Abstractplane (http://www.abstractplane.com) has an industrial-strength vdig 
component for QuickTime on Windows which you can try.             
   
Compiling:

You may need to copy the header file tkFont.h from the Tk sources to the typical place
for Tcl include files.
 
Mac OS X:

Use the Xcode project.

Win32:

If you compile under windows the 'Cursor' symbol in 'X.h' need to be redefined 
as 'XCursor', just as what is done on the Mac.         
It may also be necessary to comment out the enum MEDIA_TYPE in moviesformat.h.

    
BUGS:   

If you want to see some printouts of what is happening inside QuickTimeTcl, use the 
command 'quicktimetcl::debuglevel 3'.
    
-   There are some tuning to be done to get maximal performance for QTVR panoramas; 
    the cursor flashes which is perhaps the cause.
		    
-   (Windows) -resizable not working.

-  The effect command not implemented yet for Mac OS X.
