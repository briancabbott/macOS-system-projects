To 3.0a3: (April «01)

     that there is no risk of any controller to be drawn when played unmapped.
        
 -   DestroyMovie is now only called as a response to a DestroyNotify event
     since direct calls resulted in crashes if any failure when creating 
     the movie.

     function to force redrawing the controller. Any 'update' commands in

     to export; added -dialog option to enable user settings. Docs.
        
 -   QuickTimeStat ICcodecs now returns {-subtype type -name name} instead of 
     a sublist for each option. QuickTimeStat Components now also gives a 
     straight list of '-key value' pairs.

(001122):

 -   In order to be compatible with Mac Tcl/Tk 8.3.2, the build process has 
     been changed. Thanks to Daniel Steffen. Merged in changes to the sources.


From 2.1.2 to 3.0a1: (September «00)
   
 -   New sequence grabber widget for previewing video from an external source.
     Supports recording and a number of options. Audio and video settings dialogs.
    
 -   New movie file open dialog with preview, 'tk_getOpenFilePreview'.

 -   Reorganized header and changed its name. Moved various things into the files
     such static function declarations etc.
    
 -   Restructured configuration handling; everything is handled by a new function,
     'ConfigureMoviePlayer' which conforms better with how other tk widgets are
     structured and is much more practical and clearer.    

 -   Tried to comply with Tcls "Engineering Manual".
    
 -   Several new options and commands, such as loopstates, loading movie from an
     url, controller tcl callback procedure, custombutton, resizable button, 
     export dialog, rate, ismovie, ispanoramic, isvisual, time, select, add, 
     default QuickTime progress dialog ...
        
 -   The tracks sub command is more or less completely new including track
     editing via a fake track clipboard that only contains references to track
     segments etc...
        
 -   A few incompatible changes: "tracks add"; all lowercase returns from 
     "tracks full", "gettime"; "getselection" -> "select"; etc...
          
 -   Numerous bug fixes: update events are now handled correctly in most cases,
     the controllers active/deactive state now set with the toplevels state, etc. 
     Some bugs left here. 
        
 -   Movie controller handling completely reorganized and put in the 
     ConfigureMoviePlayer function.
        
 -   Implemented internal clipping which was not handled at all before.    
    
 -   Endians for the four character type codes fixed.
    
 -   Translations between utf and external for tcl >8.0.
    
 -   Check for the return value fnfErr instead of creating an empty file when
     creating a FSSpec.
        
 -   The select command now accepts that the duration is optional. If no duration,
     the insertion point is just placed at the start time.
            
 -   Changed Apple routine names that collide with Window names.
    
 -   Added Apple error messages; tried to separate tcl errors from internal
     Apple (Movie Toolbox) errors.
        
 -   Support for new image format and image object interface for tcl >8.2.
    
 -   Added a "movie" command to subsequently replace the "Movie" command.
    
 -   Now possible to play sound only movies without a controller if not displayed.
    
 -   Prepared in various places for single fork movies.
    
 -   Added "QuickTimeStat ConnectSpeed" command.
