Movie - Create and manipulate movie widgets for video, audio, animations, 
and VR panoramic pictures

<H3><A NAME="M2">SYNOPSIS</A></H3>

<B>package require QuickTimeTcl</B> ?<I>version</I>?<BR>
<B>movie </B> <I>pathname</I>  ?<I>options</I>?

<P>
To conform better with the Tcl coding practice, the old <B>Movie</B> 
command (with an uppercase M) has been replaced with the <B>movie</B> 
command (all lowercase). Although the old <B>Movie</B> command is still 
supported, its use is discouraged.

<DL>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M4">-controller</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>controller</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Controller</B> <DD>A boolean of 0 or 1 specifies if 
    the default QuickTime controller should be attached to the movie. It 
    defaults to 1. The controller allows the user to interact with the movie in 
    a simple way. Moreover, for an VR panoramic picture a controller is the 
    only way to interact with the movie. All user actions that is received by a 
    controller are handled internally in QuickTime. Unless you specify a tcl 
    command via the  <B>mccommand</B>, tcl is unaware of what is happening the 
    movie when a controller is attached. If a controller is removed from a 
    movie that has the <B>loopstate</B> or <B>palindromeloopstate</B> set, 
    these options are also removed together with the controller.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M5">-custombutton</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>customButton</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>CustomButton</B> <DD>A boolean of 0 or 1 specifies 
    if the movie controller, if any, has a custom button placed at its right 
    end. It defaults to 0. To do anything useful, a Tcl command must be 
    registered with <B>mccommand</B>. The global coordinates of the mouse click 
    can be used to pop up a Tcl menu, for instance. A custom button is 
    typically used in the QuickTime plugin for web browsers, where it is used 
    for a pop up menu so that the user can perform some simple tasks from the 
    controller directly, such as to save the movie to disk.

    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M6">-file</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>file</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>File</B> <DD>Specifies the file path for the file to 
    read the movie from. For instance, the following sequence first displays 
    the first movie, and then, if necessary, resize, and display the second 
    movie:
    
    <PRE>
movie .m -file sample.mov
pack .m
.m configure -file qtvr.mov
</PRE>

    Configurations you may have made with the previous movie are likely (?) 
    to be lost while loading another movie in the same widget.

    <P><DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M-highlightbackground">-highlightbackground</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>highlightBackground</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>HighlightBackground</B>
    <DD>Specifies the color to display in the traversal highlight region when
    the widget does not have the input focus.
    
    <P><DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M-highlightcolor">-highlightcolor</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>highlightColor</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>HighlightColor</B>
    <DD>Specifies the color to use for the traversal highlight rectangle that is
    drawn around the widget when it has the input focus.
    
    <P><DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M-highlightthickness">-highlightthickness</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>highlightThickness</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>HighlightThickness</B>
    <DD>Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the highlight
    rectangle to draw around the outside of the widget when it has the
    input focus.
    If the value is zero, no focus highlight is drawn around the widget.

    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M7">-height</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>height</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Height</B> <DD> By default, the size of the movie 
    widget is the "natural" size of the movie. If a nonzero value for either 
    <B>height</B> or <B>width</B> is set, the movie will be this size. The 
    default of 0 means that this option should be ignored, and the movies 
    natural height be used. Note that these are "sticky" and are not cleared if 
    the file name is changed.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M8">-loadcommand</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>loadCommand</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>LoadCommand</B> <DD> Registers a 
    Tcl command procedure to be called whenever the load state of a remote 
    movie changes, and it allows the loading to be asynchronous. If a movie is 
    specified with the <B>url</B> option, the default behaviour is that 
    everything that needs to be made in order to open the movie, network 
    connections and such, is done in blocking mode. Since this is usually a 
    somewhat time consuming process, using the <B>loadcommand</B>, the 
    <B>movie</B> command returns immediately, and the registered tcl command 
    gets called when something happens to the process of loading the movie. 
    Specifying this command only allows the movie to be loaded 
    asynchronously, it is not required to do so. This is handled internally 
    in QuickTime, and is beoynd my control.
    The Tcl procedure should have this form:
    
    <PRE>proc MyLoadCommandProc { widget message {err {}} }</PRE>
    
    where <CODE>widget</CODE> is the movie widget, and <CODE>message</CODE> is 
    one of <B>loading</B>, <B>playable</B>, <B>playthroughok</B>, or <B>complete</B>, 
    in that order. 
    Not each of the states is necessarily called, and any single state may 
    be called more than once.
    The movie cannot be mapped or configured until its state is at 
    least <B>playable</B>, and it cannot be saved to disk unless it is 
    <B>complete</B>. When the state is at least <B>playthroughok</B>,
    the movie can be started and played to end without any intermittency.
    If <B>err</B> is nonzero, an error has occured, where <B>err</B> contains  a descriptive 
    message.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M308">-loadintoram</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>loadIntoRam</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>LoadIntoRam</B> <DD>A boolean value determines 
    if the movie should be completely read into memory. It defaults to 
    false. This is only 
    advisable for small movies. Alert sounds, and other small size sounds, that need 
    to be started without the extra time delay a disk access implies, can 
    be stored into memory this way.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M9">-loopstate</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>loopstate</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Loopstate</B> <DD>A boolean value determines the 
    movie's loopstate. It is 0 for ordinary playback, but if 1, the movie is 
    restarted from the beginning once it has reached its end, indefinitely. To 
    start looping a movie, first set its loopstate, and then play it.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M10">-mccommand</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>mcCommand</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>MCCommand</B> <DD> Registers a Tcl command procedure 
    to be called from the QuickTime movie controller. This enables the script 
    writer to monitor what is going on inside the controller.  The argument to 
    <B>mccommand</B> is just the name of the Tcl procedure. The Tcl command 
    function should have this form:
    
    <PRE>proc MyMCCommandProc {widget message {par {}}}</PRE>
    
    where widget is the movie widget path, message any of  <B>activate</B>, 
    <B>customButtonClick</B>, <B>deactivate</B>, <B>key</B>, <B>goToTime</B>, 
    <B>mouseDown</B>, <B>play</B>, <B>setSelectionBegin</B>, 
    <B>setSelectionDuration</B>, or <B>setVolume</B>. Some messages have 
    parameters associated with them; <B>customButtonClick</B> appends a list 
    {<I>x</I> <I>y</I>}, where <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are the global coordinates 
    of the mouse click on the <B>custombutton</B>; the <B>goToTime</B> appends 
    a list of three time values <CODE>{ <I>hiTime loTime timeScale</I>}</CODE> 
    as a response to interactions with the scale button, where <I>hiTime</I> is 
    the high order number of the position (usually 0), <I>loTime</I> the 
    (lo)position in the movie, and <I>timeScale</I> the movie's time scale; 
    <B>key</B> appends the actual character pressed; <B>mouseDown</B> appends a 
    list {<I>x</I> <I>y</I>}, where <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are the global 
    coordinates of the mouse click inside the movie; <B>setSelectionBegin</B> 
    appends the start selection movie time if the controller with -mcedit 
    enabled is shift dragged, tends to repeat itself also if only 
    setSelectionDuration changes; <B>setSelectionDuration</B> appends the 
    duration of the selection in movie time if the controller with -mcedit 
    enabled is shift dragged; <B>play</B> appends the rate (from 0.0 to 1.0) at 
    which the movie is played when the play button is clicked, and is 0.0 when 
    the movie stops; <B>setVolume</B> appends the volume set as a number 
    between -256 and 256, where 0 is no volume. There are more message types 
    than can be implemented if needed.
    
    <P>
    For QTVR panoramic movies, not all of the above callbacks apply, and 
    instead some additional callbacks are valid. The additional messages 
    are <B>fieldofview</B>, <B>pan</B>, <B>tilt</B>, and <B>triggerhotspot</B>.
    The parameter associated with the <B>fieldofview</B> is a float of 
    unknown dimension, <B>pan</B> and <B>tilt</B> are associated angles 
    in degrees. The <B>triggerhotspot</B> is followed by an id number of 
    the hot spot the user clicked.
    
    <P>
    If the tcl callback procedure returns a break result code, by
    <CODE>return -code 3</CODE> (is there a better way?), the corresponding action in the
    movie is not taken place. This may be used to constrain user actions in 
    movies.

    <DT>Database Name: <B>mcEdit</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>MCEdit</B> <DD>A boolean value determines if editing 
    is possible via the controller. Shift drag the controller to make a movie selection.
    Many more <B>paste</B> operations are possible since all movie import 
    components are made available. See <A HREF="movie.html#M20">EDITING</A>.

    <DT>Database Name: <B>palindromeLoopstate</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>PalindromeLoopstate</B> <DD>A boolean value 
    determines the movie's palindrome loopstate. It is 0 for ordinary playback, 
    but if 1, the movie starts to play backwards when it has reached its end, 
    and starts to play forward again when it has reached its beginning, 
    indefinitely. To start palindrome looping a movie, first set its palindrome 
    loopstate, and then play it.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M12">-preferredrate</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>preferredRate</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>PreferredRate</B> <DD>The default playback rate for 
    the movie, between -1.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 is the normal play rate. Slow 
    motion playback is achieved by a rate smaller than 1.0, and the movie runs 
    backward for negative rates. This option is only effective if the 
    <B>play</B> command is used---if you use the controller it plays with a 
    rate 1.0.
    
    <P>
    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M13">-progressproc</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>progressProc</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>ProgressProc</B> <DD> Specifies a Tcl progress 
    procedure which will be called every once in a while by QuickTime while a 
    long operation is going on. The argument to <B>progressProc</B> is just the 
    name of the Tcl procedure. The Tcl progress function should have this form:
    
    <PRE>proc MyProgressProc {widget message operation percent}</PRE>
    
    where widget is the movie widget path, message any of  <B>open</B>, 
    <B>percent</B>, <B>close</B>, or <B>cancel</B>, the operation is a text 
    describing the QuickTime operation taking place, and percent is a number 
    between 0 and 100 telling the percentage done. If you are going to 
    cancel the operation, then return a break code: <CODE>return -code 3</CODE> 
    (is there a better way?).

    <DT>Database Name: <B>qtvrQualityMotion</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>QTVRQualityMotion</B> <DD>Specifies the imaging 
    rendering quality for moving images of QTVR panoramas. It is one of 
    <B>min</B>, <B>low</B>, <B>normal</B>, <B>high</B>, or <B>max</B>. Its

    <DT>Database Name: <B>qtvrQualityStatic</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>QTVRQualityStatic</B> <DD>Specifies the imaging 
    rendering quality for static images of QTVR panoramas. It is one of 
    <B>min</B>, <B>low</B>, <B>normal</B>, <B>high</B>, or <B>max</B>. Its

    <DT>Database Name: <B>resizable</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Resizable</B> <DD> This is a boolean option of 0 or 
    1 that specifies if a resize button should be placed in the right end of 
    the controller. It defaults to 0. The resize button enables the user to 
    resize the movie, keeping the proportions between width and height. By a 
    click and drag action, a gray ghost rectangle is drawn to show the movies 
    final size. The size change is automatically propagated to the Tcl geometry 
    management system when the button is released.

    1 that specifies if a QTVR panoramic movie should transition smoothly 
    when setting any of <B>fieldofview</B>, <B>pan</B>, or <B>tilt</B>.
    Only applicable for a QTVR panoramic movie. The speed is set by the 
    <B>-swingspeed</B> option.

    <DT>Command-Line Name: <B><A NAME="M16">-url</A></B>
    <DT>Database Name: <B>url</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Url</B> <DD> This is a text string that specifies 
    where to get the movie. It must be a valid url, and you must be connected 
    to a network for it to be downloaded. It is allowed to have an 
    ordinary file path, even relative ones, like <CODE>../Movies/snakes.mov</CODE>.
    Both the <B>file</B> and the 
    <B>url</B> option cannot be specified simultaneously. The remote file can 
    have any format that is accepted by QuickTime. It may be a movie that is 
    stored on disk on the remote system, or it can be a small (typically 200 
    bytes) so called sdr file, that specifies how QuickTime should obtain the 
    movie content as a live streaming audio/video movie. A movie controller 
    must be attached to the movie to enable the user to control the operation. 
    The operation to connect to the remote site, and to download as much of the 
    movie to determine its size etc., is done in blocking mode if not a 
    <B>loadcommand</B> is specified. On a slow dial up connection it can take 
    some time; for a sdr file it usually doesn't take very long since it is so 
    small. In addition, for a live stream (sdr file) the user must press the 
    start button for QuickTime to make the neccessary connections; this is done 
    in nonblocking mode. QuickTime recognizes a movie that has a format 
    prepared for streaming (over ftp or http), and the command returns 
    when enough has been downloaded to know its size etc. This usually 
    corresponds to only a small portion of the total movie, and it is 
    therefore usually reasonably fast.
    If a <B>loadcommand</B> is specified, the <B>movie</B> 
    command returns immediately, but the movie cannot be used until the 
    corresponding Tcl procedure has received a <B>playable</B> message. If you 
    want to prepare your own movies for streaming they must first be flattened 
    using the <B>flatten</B> command.

    <DT>Database Name: <B>volume</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Volume</B> <DD> Sets the volume of all the audio

    <DT>Database Name: <B>width</B>
    <DT>Database Class: <B>Width</B> <DD> By default, the size of the movie 
    widget is the "natural" size of the movie. If a nonzero value for either 
    <B>height</B> or <B>width</B> is set, the movie will be this size. The 
    default of 0 means that this option should be ignored, and the movies 
    natural width be used. Note that these are "sticky" and are not cleared if 
    the file name is changed.

<H3><A NAME="M19">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>

The movie widget is a widget for playback of video, audio, animations, and 
VR panoramic images. A <I>QuickTime movie</I> is the name of a hierarchical 
structure that organizes data that has a time structure, such as video and 
sound. On top of this hierarchy is the QuickTime movie itself. The movie 
has a timescale associated with it, typically 600, that tells how many 
"ticks" there are on each second. A position in the movie, or a duration of 
the movie, is always expressed in terms of the movie's time scale as an 
integer number. For instance, if a movie has a time scale of 600, then two 
seconds from the movie's beginning corresponds to a "time" 1200.

<P>
The movie contains a number of <I>tracks</I>. Each track has a unique ID 
number, that is unique through the lifetime of the movie. That is, if track 
1 is deleted, there will never be a track 1 in this movie anymore. Each 
track may only contain one type of <I>media</I>. A media type specifies the 
sort of media, for instance, images, sounds, video etc. In the usual Mac 
way, a four letter combination specifies the media type. Choices are:

<UL>
    <LI><CODE>hndl</CODE> : handle to the memory
    <LI><CODE>MPEG</CODE> : MPEG
    <LI><CODE>musi</CODE> : music
    <LI><CODE>qd3d</CODE> : QuickDraw 3D model
    <LI><CODE>rsrc</CODE> : resource
    <LI><CODE>soun</CODE> : sound
    <LI><CODE>sprt</CODE> : sprite animation
    <LI><CODE>text</CODE> : text
    <LI><CODE>tmcd</CODE> : time code
    <LI><CODE>twen</CODE> : 'Tween track
    <LI><CODE>vide</CODE> : video
</UL>

Each track references one or many <I>media samples</I> which in turn points 
on the actual data for the movie. Each media has its own timescale which 
need not be identical to the movie's time scale. For example, a video track 
can have a time scale of 30 (frames per second), and an audio track 44,100 
(samples per second). A movie file typically contains a movie, one or more 
tracks, each containing its own media samples, everything bundled together. 
A track must not extend from the movies beginning to its end. Instead, the 
<I>offset</I> specifies the start of the track, and the <I>duration</I> 
specifies the length of the track. Both values are expressed in terms of 
the movie's time scale. A movie's <I>rate</I> determines how many time 
scale units in the movie actually run each real-time second. For instance, 
if a movie's time scale is 600, a rate 1.0 means that QuickTime will 
process 600 scale units of the movie each second. A negative rate means the 
movie is running backwards. The play rate is the "speed" of the movie; if 
it's not playing it is 0.0. By setting the play rate to a nonzero value the 
movie may start playing.

<P>
Each track is associated with a layer, numbered from -32768 to 32767, that 
controls how tracks are combined to display a movie. QuickTime displays 
higher ordered layers first, placing lower-numbered layers on top of them. 
Each layer can be associated with any number of tracks. By default, a newly 
created track has layer 0.

<P>
The movie widget supports all formats that QuickTime supports. A few 
comments: a VR panoramic movie has no time structure but works roughly like 
an ordinary movie, with exceptions that operations that are time specific 
doesn't work. QuickTime supports many still image formats. These are 
included automatically via the <B>image create photo</B> command when 
QuickTimeTcl is loaded.

<P>
Movies may be files on a local disk, loaded with the <B>-file</B> option, 
or remote movies, loaded with the <B>-url</B> option. Realtime streaming 
movies are usually represented by a so called sdr file, typically with an 
extension .mov, that gets loaded internally in QuickTime when using the 
<B>-url</B> option. But it is also possible to get the sdr file, once 
located in a html page, by other means, such as a web browser or whatever. 
If this small sdr file on your local disk is specified with the 
<B>-file</B> option, QuickTime automatically understands that it should 
connect to a live stream. Well known streaming channels usually keep the 
sdr file unchanged, so you may speed up the process by using the local sdr 
file instead of specifying the <B>-url</B> option each time.

<P>
This package requires QuickTime version 3, but some options, such as the 
<B>-url</B> option, requires at least QuickTime 4. When new formats are 
introduced by Apple or others, the API's are usually unchanged, and the new 
formats are therefore automatically supported by this package. For detailed 
information on the supported file types for any particular QuickTime 
version visit  <CODE>www.apple.com/quicktime</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="M201">SOUND ONLY</A></H3>

Although most movies are associated with visual media, this is not always true,
for instance, for movies with only a sound track. 
However, this movie widget is  centered around a graphics widget, so how 
are sound only movies played if you dont want to see anything on the 
screen? To help you organize your sound movies, create a fake frame widget 
that never gets mapped. Then  create your movies the ordinary way, but 
without a controller. An example:

<PRE>frame .fake
movie .fake.m -file Madonna.mp3 -controller 0
.fake.m play
</PRE>

one entity, there are commands that allow you to pick apart and assemble a 
movie by <B>cut</B>, <B>copy</B>, and <B>paste</B>.  
Editing is done in two different modes, either via a controller with editing
enabled, using the <B>-mcedit</B> command, or without. We denote the last 
variant "simple" editing. Simple editing can be done with or without a 
controller, and some if its behaviour is different from editing through the 
controller, most notably the <B>paste</B> command. This is Apples choice, 
and not mine. Lets first describe simple editing:

<P>
There are two 
different editing capabilities provided for simple editing: <I>movie</I> editing, and 
<I>track</I> editing. Both way of editing typically use a time value and a 
duration, both expressed in the movie's time scale.
Simple editing can only handle pasting other movies from
the clipboard.

<P>
The movie editing commands act on all tracks in a movie---cutting a 
selection removes all tracks in that selection. In addition, there is one 
command that works selectively on certain tracks, the <B>add</B> command. 
The <B>add</B> command is like <B>paste</B> but it adds tracks in parallel, 
possibly using existing tracks to put the media in. A typical movie edit 
sequence is like:

<PRE>.m select 1200 600
.m copy
.m select 2400
.m paste
</PRE>

<P>
Track editing, like <B>tracks copy</B> and <B>tracks paste</B>,  has no 
high level support, and is only provided by references. There exist not a 
physical clipboard where track segments are kept, but the track clipboard 
is a fake clipboard that cannot hold track segments, only references to 
them. This limits track editing a bit. For instance, there is no tracks cut 
command. A number of the <B>tracks</B> sub commands act either on complete 
tracks, or on any existing selection of any track segment in the movie. 
There may be only a single track selection per movie.
A typical track edit sequence is like:

<PRE>.m tracks select 1 1200 600
.m tracks copy
.m tracks select 1 2400
.m tracks paste
</PRE>

<P>
Beware, do not mix movie editing with tracks editing, they don't work well 
together since tracks can't be pasted as movies and vice versa. Since track 
editing works by references, if the content referred to on the track 
clipboard is changed somehow, the track clipboard is invalidated. The 
following is valid to avoid interference between the movie and track 
clipboard, and to make it feel like one and the same clipboard:

<UL>
    <LI>A movie selection invalidates any track selection and vice versa.
    <LI>If a movie segment is pasted to the clipboard, any track clipboard 
    content is zeroed, and vice versa.
</UL>

Editing via a controller with editing enabled (<B>-mcedit</B>) is like 
simple movie editing above, but more flexible in some situations. The controller knob 
changes its appearence when editing is enabled. Selections can be made by 
shift dragging the knob. The importer not only recognizes other movies, but 
also text, still images, and everything else that makes sense. This makes 
the paste command more flexible, and also enables some more options to the 
paste command.

<H3><A NAME="M206">TEXT</A></H3>

Text can be imported in a number of ways into a text track. The simplest 
way to import text into a movie is simply to use an ordinary text file for 
the <B>-file</B> option. The text importer creates a movie that has a text 
sample for every paragraph of text in the file. Each text sample will have 
a default duration of two seconds.

<P>
More control gives the <CODE>pathName tracks add text ...</CODE> command.
Together with the graphics mode for the track it is possible to set the 
parts of the text track where no text is transparent. A typical code 
sequence can be:
<PRE>% .m tracks new text
{-undostate 0} 3
% .m tracks add text 3 0 1200 {Hello world!}
{-undostate 1}
% .m tracks configure 3 -graphicsmode transparent -graphicsmodecolor black
% .m save</PRE>

<P>
If you want to make a text movie from scratch, one example is the 
following:
<PRE>% movie .m
% .m new myText.mov
-1
% .m tracks new text 100 200
{-undostate 0} 1
# The track id is 1.
% pack .m
% .m tracks add text 1 0 1800 Hello -scrollin 1 -scrollout 1 -font {Times 24 italic}
{-undostate 1}
% .m save
</PRE>
See the docs for the individual tracks command and options for detailed 
info.

<P>
There is also more complex way to import text via so called text descriptors,
see for instance <A 
HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/tutorials/texttracks.html">
www.apple.com/quicktime/products/tutorials/texttracks.html</A>, and  
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/tutorials/textdescriptors.html">
www.apple.com/quicktime/products/tutorials/textdescriptors.html</A>.
Text descriptors enable many configuration options, such as font selection, 
colors, position, a time line for placing text, clickable URL's, and much 
more. The first piece in such a file is <CODE>{QTText}</CODE>. A minimalistic example is:
<PRE>{QTText}{font:Tekton}{plain}{size:18}{textColor: 0, 0, 0}{backColor: 65535, 65535, 0}
{justify: center}{timeScale: 600}{width: 240}{height: 40}{shrinkTextBox:on}
[00:00:00.000]
{textBox: 10, 0, 30, 240}We forgot to seed!
[00:00:01.000]
{textBox: 10, 0, 30, 240}We forgot to what?
[00:00:02.000]
{textBox: 10, 10, 30, 240}Yes and No
[00:00:03.000]
</PRE>
The file must end with a time notation, and possibly a new line.
Place your text descriptors in an ordinary text file, and just open a new 
movie specify this file as the <B>-file</B> option.

<H3><A NAME="M212">STILL IMAGES AS MOVIES</A></H3>

The movie importer is flexible enough to understand still images as well.
This can have some advantages compared to the <B>image create photo</B> command,
even if this command gets extended to many formats with QuickTimeTcl.
Use <B>-controller 0</B>  to supress the controller. First, images can be 
resized to any size. Second, using the <B>-url</B> and <B>-loadcommand</B> 
an image can be loaded remotely and asynchronously. For the moment it is 
necessary to have a controller for this.

<H3><A NAME="M313">MAKING MOVIES</A></H3>

While this package does not help creating the actual content of a movie, it 
helps you to assemble the content into a movie. A typical movie contains an audio 
track and a video track. Assembling the audio track is best made by 
cutting and pasting of the individual tracks from some original sound track.
Use the <A HREF="movie.html#M20">tracks editing</A> commands here.

<P>
A video track consists of a sequence of still images. The images you must 
produce yourself, save them to disk in an appropriate format, import them 
into Tcl using the <B>image create photo</B> command. The key command for 
adding them to a movie is <B>tracks add picture</B>, which has enough 
options to use most of QuickTime internals for building a movie. In order 
to build a movie that takes up a minimum of storge, yet has good playback 
and image qualites, you must know something about compressor types.
Apple supplies at least six standard types. List the available compressor 
types by <B>::quicktimetcl::info components imco</B> or 
<B>::quicktimetcl::info iccodecs</B>.
The six standard types and their characteristics are:
<DL>
    <DT><B>rpza</B>: Video Compressor
    <DD>Best used for sequences. Use it preferrably for video content than 
    synthetically generated images.It supports both spatial and temporal 
    cmpressions.
    <P>
    <DT><B>jpeg</B>: Photo Compressor
    <DD>Not for sequences. Best adapted to images that varies smoothly 
    without sharp contrasts. Used typically for 24 bit colors and 8 bit 
    grayscale images.
    <P>
    <DT><B>{rle }</B>: Animation Compressor
    <DD>Best for animation and computer-generated video content. Works by 
    run-length coding data, either lossless or lossy. Not suited for 
    photos and sequences that varies rapidly.
    Works at all pixel depths.
    <P>
    <DT><B>{raw }</B>: Raw Compressor
    <DD>Works by decreasing the color depth of the image.
    <P>
    <DT><B>{smc }</B>: Graphics Compressor
    <DD>Best suited for 8 bit still images and sequences. Gives typically 
    a doubled compression ratio compared to the Animation Compressor. Has, 
    however, a slower decompression.
    <P>
    <DT><B>cvid</B>: Compact Video Compressor (Cinepak)
    <DD>Best suited for 24 bit and 16 bit video sequences. Compared to 
    the Video Compressor, this compressor obtains higher compression 
    ratios, better image quality, and faster playback speeds. It is, 
    however, much slower for compression.
</DL>

There are also DV image compressors. The NTSC DV compressor (<B>{dvc }</B>) generates 720 
x 480 frames, and the PAL DV compressor (<B>dvcp</B>)generates 720 x 576 frames.
Since each one of these compressors, and the others at your system, only 
support a subset of the possible compression options as given by the 
<B>tracks add picture</B> command, it can be tricky to find a combination 
that is supported. Use the <B>-dialog 1</B> option to assist you in this 
search.
It is important to distinguish between single image compression and 
sequence compression. Using a list of a number of images for the <B>tracks add 
picture</B> command is very different from using this command repeatedly on 
the individual images, since the sequence compression treats the images as 
a sequence (sic), and thereby achieving considerable compression not 
possible by adding them separately.
When using the <B>-dialog 1</B> option, many things are handled 
automatically internally in the compressor component. You may choose 
compressors that does not allow sequence compression, even if a list of 
images is specified.

    
<H3><A NAME="M306">SAVING MOVIES</A></H3>

Once the movie has been edited, or it has perhaps been obtained remotely 
using the <B>-url</B> option, it is time to save it. There are four 
different ways to do it: <B>save</B>, <B>saveas</B>, <B>flatten</B>, 
<B>compress</B>, or <B>export</B>.
They typically work as any corresponding menu command would work, but with 
some important differences. There are two things that complicates this.
Before discussing this, we must make a distinction between the "movie 
resource" and "movie data". Each movie consists of these two parts. The 
movie resource is generally a small structure that keeps track of the 
movie's data, which contains all video frames, audio etc., and is therefore 
orders of magnitude larger than the movie's resource.

<P>
Note these two features that complicate things:
First, the standard Macintosh file contains both a data fork, and a so 
called resource fork, whereas Windows lacks this file structure. The 
resource fork of a file has in principal nothing to do with the movie's 
resource.
Second, not all movie files need to be self contained, that is, the movie 
data must not be in the same file as the movie resource. This may seem 
like a very weird feature, but is actually very useful since the movie 
data, which can be several hundred MB in size, need not be duplicated when 
saving an edited movie.

<P>
The <B>save</B> command saves the movie back in its original file, using 
the resource fork or the data fork whichever corresponds to the original 
file. If you want to store 
the movie with a different file name, use the <B>saveas</B> command.
This updates the <B>-filename</B> option to the new file name.
It does not reorganize the movies internal structure.
The <B>saveas</B> command saves only the movie resource, and does not 
duplicate the movie data. You may optionally save the movie resource in 
the files resource fork, which on Windows creates a separate file. Thus, 
<B>saveas</B> command does not make self contained movie files.

<P>
The <B>flatten</B> command is typically used for storing movies that 
should be distributed via a server to the network. It may reorganize the 
original movies internal structure. Both the movie resource and its data 
are saved in the same file, and thus makes a self contained movie file.
The <B>flatten</B> command does not update the <B>-filename</B> option, 
and the movie in the actual widget is not affected by <B>flatten</B>. If 
you want to operate on the flattened movie file, make a new movie widget 
from the flattened movie file. Also, if you have made a number of edits
on a movie, there may be media data in the movie that is not used anymore.
In order to make a "clean" movie, removing unused media data, you may flatten it.

<P>
The <B>export</B> command is the most versatile, 
and facilitates storing 
movies in all formats that there are export components for via dialogs. 
It leaves the movie corresponding to the widget unchanged.
The <B>export</B> command is a kind of "saveas" command that enables the
user to specify the destination file.

<P>
A typical movie edit session may be like:
<PRE>.m -file myFile.mov
.
edit stuff
.
.m saveas myNewFile.mov
.
edit stuff
.
.m saveas myNewFile2.mov
.m flatten myCannesWinner.mov
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="M327">VIDEO EFFECTS</A></H3>
The <I>pathName</I> <B>effect</B> command adds real time video effects to a 
movie. They are categorized as zero, one, or two source effects, see the 
description below for a details. A two source effect is somewhat more 
difficult to use since there must be two overlapping tracks, with the 
overlap equal to the duration of the effect. An example to create a movie 
from scratch using two images from disk is:
<PRE>% movie .m
% .m new myEffect.mov
% .m tracks new video 200 200
{-undostate 0} 1
% .m tracks new video 200 200
{-undostate 1} 2

# The track id's are 1 and 2.
# Make two images in tk from two images on disk. 
# Preferrably of the same size as the video track, else they are scaled 
automatically.
% set firstImage [image create photo -file [tk_getOpenFile]]
% set secondImage [image create photo -file [tk_getOpenFile]]
% pack .m
% .m tracks add picture 1 0 6000 $firstImage
% .m tracks add picture 2 0 6000 $secondImage

# Shift the second track to make the desired overlap.
% .m tracks configure 2 -offset 3000

# Pick the wanted effect in the dialog.
% .m effect 3000 3000 1 2
</PRE>

<P>
One important feature of the effects dialog is that the command returns 
almost immediately, before the user has pressed any buttons. A variable
<B>::quicktimetcl::effectfinished</B> is set to -1 before the effect 
command returns, and is set to 0 or 1 when the user is finished with the dialog;
0 if cancelled, 1 if ok.
Use the following code to be sure that the script after the 
command is actually executed after the user is finished with the dialog.
<PRE>.m effect 3000 3000 1 2
tkwait variable ::quicktimetcl::effectfinished
...
.m save
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="M21">WIDGET COMMAND</A></H3>

The <B>movie</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is 
<I>pathName</I>.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on 
the widget.  It has the following general form:

<PRE><I>pathName option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?</PRE>

<I>Option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s determine the exact behavior of the 
command.  The time values and durations are always given in the movie's 
time scale if not otherwise stated. The following commands are possible for 
movie widgets:

<P>

<DL>
    
    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="M22"><I>pathName </I><B>add</B> </A> <DD>This command adds the 
    tracks from the source movie on the scrap to the destination movie. It 
    scales the source movie to fit into the selection of the destination movie. 
    If there is no selection, but merely an insertion point in the destination 
    movie, QuickTime adds the tracks at the insertion point. In contrast to the 
    <B>paste</B> command, this command does not "cut through" any existing 
    tracks, but adds them in parallel to the tracks in the destination movie. 
    This can be useful for adding a track to an existing movie, such as adding 
    sound to a silent movie.  It returns the undo number as <CODE>{-undostate 
    <I>undoNo</I>}</CODE> which may be used to undo this command.

        
    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="M500"><I>pathName </I><B>callback</B> ?<I>args</I>?</A> <DD>
    Handle time events similar to the Tcl <B>after</B> command, but sets up
    a procedure to be called when the movie reaches a certain time when 
    played. This is a one-shot timer.
        
    <P>    
    <DL>
	<DT><A NAME="M501"><I>pathName</I> <B>callback</B> <I>movieTime procName</I></A> 
	<DD>Sets up the <I>procName</I> to be called when the movie reaches the time 
	<I>movieTime</I>when played. The call takes place at a safe 
	(non-interrupt) time after <I>movieTime</I>, which creates a slight time 
	slip. 
        The command returns a token (unique identifier) which is used 
        by other <B>callback</B> commands. 
	The <I>procName</I> shall have the following form:
	<CODE>proc MyCallBack {token pathName movieTime} {...}</CODE>.
	The first argument, <I>token</I>, is the same string that was returned 
	when setting up the callback. The <I>movieTime</I> is not the actual movie time 
	(get it with the <B>time</B> command), but the one corresponding to the 
	<B>callback</B> argument.
    </DL>
        
    <P>    
    <DL>
	<DT><A NAME="M502"><I>pathName</I> <B>callback cancel</B> <I>token</I></A> 
	<DD>Removes the callback event with the specified <I>token</I>.
    </DL>
        
    <P>    
    <DL>
	<DT><A NAME="M503"><I>pathName</I> <B>callback info</B> ?<I>token</I>?</A> 
	<DD>Without the <I>token</I> argument, it returns a list of all callback 
	tokens registered with this movie. 	
		
	If <I>token</I> is supplied, it specifies an existing handler; 
	<I>token</I> must have been the return value from some previous call to 
	<B>callback</B>, and it must not have triggered yet or been cancelled. 
	In this case the command returns a list with two elements. 
	The first element of the list is the 
	script associated with <I>token</I>, 
	and the second element is the movie time corresponding to it. 
    </DL>
	
    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="M23"><I>pathName </I><B>cget</B> <I>option</I></A><DD> Returns 
    the current value of the configuration option given by <I>option</I>. 
    <I>Option</I> may have any of the values accepted by the <B>movie</B> 
    command.

    ?<I>boolean</I>?</A><DD>Compress the movie to the file specified in 
    <I>fileName</I>. If the <I>boolean</I> is 1, an export dialog is presented 
    where the user may select from a number of options for the compression. The 
    default behaviour is not to show the dialog. Many operations can be very 
    time consuming, and since the compression is done in blocking mode, it's a 
    good idee to specify a either the <B>qtprogress</B> option, or a Tcl 
    procedure via the <B>progressProc</B> option.
    The <B>export</B> command is much more versatile than <B>compress</B>. 
    
    
    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="M25"><I>pathName </I><B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? 
    ?<I>value option value ...</I>?</A>
    <DD> Query or modify the configuration 
    options of the widget. If no <I>option</I> is specified, returns a list 
    describing all of the available options for <I>pathName</I> (see 
    <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the format of this list).  If 
    <I>option</I> is specified with no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a 
    list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the 
    corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <I>option</I> is 
    specified).  If one or more <I>option-value</I> pairs are specified, then 
    the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); 
    in this case the command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have 
    any of the values accepted by the <B>movie</B> command.

    <DT><A NAME="M205"><I>pathName </I><B>controllerinfo</B> 
    <DD>Returns a list of <I>option boolean</I> pairs describing the state
    of the movie controller. The options are <B>
    -undoavailable, -cutavailable, -copyavailable, -pasteavailable, 
    -clearavailable, -hassound, -isplaying, -islooping, -isinpalindrome,

    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="M28"><I>pathName </I><B>effect</B> <I>startTime</I> 
    <I>duration</I>  ?<I>trackOneID</I>? ?<I>trackTwoID</I>?</A> 
    <DD> The standard video effect dialog is opened where it is 
    possible to choose from a large number of video effects. 
    The effects command returns almost immediately, before the user has pressed any buttons,
    and before the dialog has popped up. A variable
    <B>::quicktimetcl::effectfinished</B> is set to -1 before the effect 
    command returns, and is set to 0 or 1 when the user is finished with the dialog;
    0 if cancelled, 1 if ok. Use <CODE>tkwait variable ::quicktimetcl::effectfinished</CODE>
    to wait for the dialog to be finished.
    <I>startTime</I> and <I>duration</I> give the 
    starting time and the length of the effect, respectively. There are 
    zero-source effects, one-source effects, and two-source effects. 
    The 
    zero-source effects add effects, such as cloud and fire, that don't require 
    a source track. A one-source effect acts as a filter for a track, and a 
    two-source effect is typically a transition effect between two tracks. If 
    no optional arguments are specified, it will result in a  zero-source effect, if 
    <I>trackOneID</I> given, a one-source effect, and if also <I>trackTwoID</I> 
    given, the result will be a two-source effect. For a zero-source 
    effect, a black background is made transparent in order to make the 
    original track, if any, show through.
    A two-source effect requires two overlapping tracks, where the overlap must 
    coincide with the <I>duration</I>, <I>startTime</I> must coincide with 
    the start of the second track, and <I>startTime</I> + <I>duration</I> 
    must coincide with the end of the first track.
    All tracks involved must 
    have a visual representation. One or more 
    additional tracks may be created as a response to this command.
    You may specify <B>end</B> for <I>duration</I> (and <I>startTime</I>) which extends
    the duration to the end of the movie.
    
    <P>
    <DT><A NAME="M29"><I>pathName </I><B>export</B> ?<I>option value ...</I>?</A> 
    <DD>Presents the user 
    an export dialog, a "Save As" dialog, where a large number of options can 
    be chosen for the new movie. In contrast to the <B>compress</B> dialog, a 
    file path is returned from this command, or an empty string if the user 
    cancels. Many operations can be very 
    time consuming, and since the compression is done in blocking mode, it's a 
    good idee to specify a either the <B>qtprogress</B> option, or a Tcl 
    procedure via the <B>progressProc</B> option. The movie must be mapped
    to screen for export to work.
    
    <P>
    An export operation takes place via a so called export component of 
    type <B>spit</B>, and of a certain subtype and manufacturer. These 
    three parameters are all four character wide strings, and any space in 
    any of these must be properly conserved by embracing or quoting the 
    word. The name "manufacturer" is a bit of a misnomer since it usually 
    specifies the media type that a component supports, or typically <B>appl</B>
    if more than one media type is exported. 
    You may investigate the presently available export component on your
    system from the command <B>::quicktimetcl::info components spit</B>.
    If you specify any particular export component, you must be confident 
    that it supports the actual movie.
    For instance, you can only use the VR export components (manufacture: 
    <B>vrob</B>, <B>vrsp</B>, <B>vrwe</B>) 
    for VR movies.
    
    <P>
    For each component the internal parameter settings are stored 
    internally, and may be reused in the same session without showing a dialog each time. A 
    typical usage is:
    <PRE>
# Investigate our export components.
::quicktimetcl::info components spit

# Configure a specific export component using its dialog.

    <P>
    As an alternative, to store component settings between sessions, you 
    may store them to file, and read in them later without dialog. 
    You are responsible that the components are identical when settings 
    are written, and when read in later. It may be helpful to pick a 
    descriptive name for the settings, such as "MooVapplSorenson3" etc.
    A typical usage is:
    <PRE>
# Configure a specific export component using its dialog.
.m export -file kass.mov -codecsubtype MooV -mediatype appl  \
        -savesettingstofile MooVapplSorenson3

# Reuse its settings without showing any dialog.
.m export -file kass2.mov -codecsubtype MooV -mediatype appl  \
        -readsettingsfromfile MooVapplSorenson3 -dialog 0

    <DD>Saves the movie in a self contained format. Both movie data and the
    movie resource are saved in the same file. If the <I>-resource</I> 
    option is given, the movie resource is stored in the files resource 
    fork, which on Windows makes a separate file in the same directory. 
    By default, this command interleaves audio and video data for optimal 
    playback performance. This can be switched off by the 
    <I>-dontinterleave</I> option. Only the QTVR (panorama) components support the <B>-dialog</B> 
    option. The <B>-forceresourcebeforedata</B> (default 1)
    forces the movie resource to be stored in from of the movie data.
    This command does not alter the movie in the widget. To 
    work on the newly flattened movie you need to open it with a new 
    widget (or <B>configure</B> with the <B>-file</B> option).

    <DD>Create 
    a new movie in file <I>fileName</I>. By default, a single fork movie 
    file is created with everything in the data fork. This should always be 
    used on Windows. On the mac, specifying a resource id creates a double 
    fork movie, with the movie in the resource fork. If  <I>id</I> is 0, 
    the first empty resource is used, which is always 128 or larger. If a 
    specific resource id is given, it must be 128 or larger. A resource id

    This command pastes what is stored on the scrap into the movie. It 
    works differently whether the controller has editing 
    enabled or not (<B>-mcedit</B>, see <A HREF="movie.html#M20">EDITING</A>).
    Whenever possible, QuickTime tries to reuse any tracks 
    that can be reused, but creates new ones if the source movie contains 
    tracks that can't be matched with any track in the destination movie. The 
    paste operation cuts through all tracks and adds empty space in existing 
    tracks if necessary. If you just want to add another movie's tracks in 
    "parallel" with the destination movie, use the <B>add</B> command. It 
    returns the undo number as <CODE>{-undostate <I>undoNo</I>}</CODE> which

    <DD>Methods to create and manipulate timecode tracks. A timecode track 
    displays a video tracks timing information as a text string 
    <CODE>HH:MM:SS:FF</CODE>, where <CODE>HH</CODE> are hours, <CODE>MM</CODE> minutes, 
    <CODE>SS</CODE> seconds, 
    and <CODE>FF</CODE> the number of frames since last second.
    If drop frames, see below, the last colon is replaced by a semicolon.
    A timecode track is created with the same duration as the video track 
    it is referencing. The video track must have a uniform frame duration 
    for the timecode track to correctly display timing info. You typically 
    make a timecode track for each clip you make.
    The timecode track is created with a black background and white text 
    as default, and the tracks graphics mode is set to <B>addmax</B> (see 
    Apple docs for this). This has the effect of making the black 
    background transparent. A tracks graphics transfer modes is 
    investigated and set via the <B>tracks configure</B> command.
    If you would like to have black text instead, follow this code example:
    <PRE>
.m timecode new 1 -foreground black -background white
.m tracks configure 4 -graphicsmode addmin
</PRE>
Or if the solid background and foreground colors are preferred, set the 
timecode tracks graphics mode to the copy mode:
    <PRE>
.m tracks configure 4 -graphicsmode {dithercopy copy}
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="M87">BINDINGS</A></H3>

The binding class for all movie widgets is <B>Movie</B>. 
QuickTime adds a few bindings by its own.
For a VR panorama movie, there are number of mouse bindings that 
are used to control the view in the picture. For an ordinary, linear, movie with a 
controller, a 
double click starts the movie, and a single click stops it.
<P>
There are a few key bindings that QuickTimeTcl adds. The movie must have
focus as usual for these to be active. Either click the widget, or set focus 
by the <B>focus</B> command. Linear means ordinary movie, else it's either 
a panoramic movie or an object movie.
