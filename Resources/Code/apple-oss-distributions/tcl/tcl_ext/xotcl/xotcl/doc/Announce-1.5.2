Announcing XOTcl 1.5.2
*************************

Hi everybody. We are pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.5.2.
Major changes relative to 1.5.2 are:

    * Improved Functionality

        + allowing to trace objects as well as classes via the
           package xotcl::trace (many thanks to jima for suggesting this)

    * Improved code quality: 
       + terminating all vararg lists in C by ..., (char *) NULL
           There was a problem with this on 64bit AMD on FreeBSD,
           as some lists were terminated previously by an integer typed
           zero-value.
        + better handling of Tcl result objects. Make sure that
           no changes happen on shared objects. Removed all
           occurrences of Tcl_AppendResult() from xotcl.c
        + Fixed memory corruption (accessing feed memory) in
           the invalidation of transitive mixins (many thanks to 
           Don Porter for reporting)

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
