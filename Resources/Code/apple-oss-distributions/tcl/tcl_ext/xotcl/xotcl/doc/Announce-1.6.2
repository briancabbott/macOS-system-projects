Announcing XOTcl 1.6.2
*************************

We are pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.6.2

Major changes relative to 1.6.1 are:

   * Functional extensions:
      - handle nonposargs in method "copy" properly

      - new command ::xotcl::finalize 
       (for forcing cleanup and destuctor execution at a time in 
       a multi-threaded environment, where it is still safe to execute
       all Tcl commands)

   * Extended and generalized "info" method

    - Added "<class> mixinof -closure ?pattern?"
      Query the objects for which <class> is used as a per-object-mixin 
      (directly or indirectly)

   * Fixes for potential crashes

    - Implemented proper downgrading of Classes to Objects (handle
      cases, where something was created first as an object and is
      reclassed/recreated later as a class) and vice versa

    - Reset mixin order for per-object mixins, when the superclass of
      a class is deleted, which is used as per-object mixin


   * Improved documentation

   * Extended regression tests

   * Some code cleanup

 

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
