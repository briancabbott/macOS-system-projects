Announcing XOTcl 1.6.3
*************************

We are pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.6.3

Major changes relative to 1.6.2 are:

   * Functional improvements:

       - simplified and generalized handling of namespaced instance
         variables, where namespaced associative arrays could conflict
         with global variables due to Tcl's default namespace
         resolution. Many thanks to Stefan Sobernig for this
         contribution!
         
  * Fixes:
      - Corrected deletion of meta-classes. Before, it was possible
        to create undestroyable objects via complex
        meta-class structures

   * Speed improvements:
      - Use of new interfaces in Tcl 8.5 (when compiled with Tcl 8.5)
      - simplified interfaces for various C functions
      - Speed improvement for method invocation:
          * With Tcl 8.5: 10-15 %
          * With Tcl 8.4:  5-10 %

   * Improve code quality:
       - some more code cleanup
       - factoring out common code
       - using const in more cases

   * Extended regression tests

   * Improved documentation


 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
