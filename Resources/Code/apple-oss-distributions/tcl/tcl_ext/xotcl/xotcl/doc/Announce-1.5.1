Announcing XOTcl 1.5.1
*************************

Hi everybody. We are pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.5.1.
Major changes relative to 1.5.0 are:

    * Improved Functionality

        + Improved interface to develop XOTcl methods in C
           (Many thanks to Scott Gargash for the constructive discussions
           and suggestions).

           New functions imported through the XOTcl's stub interface:
            - XOTclNextCmd()
            - XOTclCallMethodWithArgs

          New constant XOTCL_NONLEAF_METHOD to allow C-implemented
          methods to call next. This constant can be passed as 5th
          argument to XOTclAddIMethod (or ...AddPMethod). The
          following is a short example for defining and registering
          a C-implemented constructor "init" to a class.

              static int MyClassInit( ClientData cdata, Tcl_Interp *interp,
                        int objc, Tcl_Obj *CONST objv[] )   {
                 int rc;
                 /*** before next ***/
                 rc = XOTclNextObjCmd(cdata, interp, objc,objv);
                 /*** after next ***/
                 return rc;
              }
              ...
              MyClass = XOTclGetClass(interp, "MyClass" );
              XOTclAddIMethod(interp, MyClass, "init", MyClassInit,
                         XOTCL_NONLEAF_METHOD, 0 );


    * Improved code quality: 
       + fixed a bug with the backward-compatible and deprecated
           "setter" interface (many thanks to Manfred Stelzhammer for
           reporting the bug)
        + fixed a bug in parsing nonpositional arguments, when
           e.g. square brackets are used in type declarations for
           parameters (Many thanks to Stefan Sobernig for reporting)
        + fixed autoname crash under Windows NT (Many thanks to Mark
           Janssen for reporting and providing a patch)
        + fixed serializer to handle deeper stratification layers
        + simplification and speedup of dispatcher
        + Makefile.in improvements for genstubs
        + Changed "test -e" to "test -f" in Makefile.in, since the
           standard test command in Solaris does not understand 
           "test -e" (Many thanks to Andreas Kupries for reporting)
        + improved 64-bit compatibility on POWER5+

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
