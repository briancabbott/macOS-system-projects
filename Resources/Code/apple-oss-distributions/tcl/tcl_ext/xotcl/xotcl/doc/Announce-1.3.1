Announcing XOTcl 1.3.1
**********************

This is a minor fix release relative to 1.3.0. This fixes a few
problems introduced in 1.3.0 (invocation of checking procs in
nonpositional argument) and has a better build support for building
XOTcl outside of the source tree, the tar files are now dist-cleaned.


Best regards,
