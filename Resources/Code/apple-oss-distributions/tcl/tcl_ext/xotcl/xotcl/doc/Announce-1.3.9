Announcing XOTcl 1.3.9
*************************

Hi everybody. I am pleased to annouce the availability of XOTcl 1.3.9.
Major changes relative to 1.3.8 are:

     * Improved Functionality
       + new subcommand for self: [self args] return the full argument list 
          of the current call
       + "<obj> info vars" does not trigger read traces on each variable anymore
       + Serializer: exportMethods accepts forwards/instforwards now 
           as well
       + new switch -nocomplain for "mixin|instmixin|filter|instfilter delete"
            to avoid error messages when deleting entries not there (similar unset) 
       + require automatically a namespace when a childobject is added
       + new command ::xotcl::__qualify: convert an relative name
           into an command name (exactly as create does it, ignoring
           namespaces from transparent interceptors)

     * Improved code quality: 
       + fixing version numbers for package require 
       + Upgraded TEA to 3.4
       + updated rpm build (many thanks to Ildiko Schmidt and Alexander Bergolth)
       + fixed bug with error propagation when getter/setter methods are 
           used for parameters (many thanks to Manfred Stelzhammer for
           pointing this out)

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
