Announcing XOTcl 1.6.1
*************************

We are pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.6.1

Major changes relative to 1.6.0 are:

   * Extended and generalized "info" method

   * Generalized serializing package: when deserializing code, now
     consistenly no constructors are called. In previous versions,
     constuctors were called on slots; due to the point above, this is
     not needed; background: the previous solution had problems in
     aolserver ns_eval, when a slot-constructor called db-functions,
     since during ns_eval, the database handles are non-functional)

   * Fixes for potential crashes when methods were called
     with invalid arguments

   * Improved documentation

   * Extended regression tests

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
