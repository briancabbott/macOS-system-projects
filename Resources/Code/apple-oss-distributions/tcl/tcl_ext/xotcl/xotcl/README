Installation of Binary Distributions
************************************

For all binary distributions firstly Tcl and Tk must be installed
properly. Binary distributions require Tcl/Tk 8.3 (included in
most Linux distributions), which you can find from:

  http://www.tcl.tk


Working with a Shell
--------------------

From version 1.1 on XOTcl does not - by default - build xotclsh and
xowish anymore. Instead you should use xotcl from tclsh or wish. The
typical way to do so is to load XOTcl as a packages and then import
the commands from the XOTcl namespace into the current namespace:

   /usr/local/bin/tclsh8.4
   package require XOTcl; namespace import -force xotcl::*

That means, the XOTcl installed package library needs to be on Tcl's
search path for packages. 

If XOTcl is not installed in the standard Tcl location, you can either
set the environment variable TCLLIBPATH from outside of Tcl to this
location, or use the variable auto_path in Tcl. For instance, to use
the local, extracted tar ball, you can use something like (under
UNIX):
  export TCLLIBPATH="./xotcl-1.3.0"  or
  setenv TCLLIBPATH "./xotcl-1.3.0"
Under Windows:
  set TCLLIBPATH=".\xotcl-1.3.0"


Linux Binary Distribution
-------------------------

Per default the Linux version install to usr/local and XOTcl
directories. If you want to install to these directions, just
  cd /
  tar xvfz xotcl-XXX.tar.gz
otherwise:
  mkdir temp-xotcl
  cd temp-xotcl
  tar xvfz xotcl-XXX.tar.gz
and then copy the file in temp-xotcl/usr/local to your installation
destination and temp-dir/xotcl where you want to have the examples
and documentation.  If the packages can not be found, try to
set the TCLLIBPATH. On Unix Systems:

csh:  setenv TCLLIBPATH "/usr/local/lib/xotcl-<VERSION>/ $(TCLLIBPATH)"
bash: export TCLLIBPATH="/usr/local/lib/xotcl-<VERSION>/ $(TCLLIBPATH)"


Windows Binary Release
----------------------

You need Tcl 8.3.* or 8.4.* installed properly. If necessary, get Tcl
8.4 for your system from 
   http://www.tcl.tk

Now check where Tcl is installed and what the name of the tclsh*.exe
is. If you installed Tcl 8.3.5, the name is tclsh83.exe. On my system
Tcl installs tclsh in c:\Programme\Tcl\bin (in English versions this
is most likely under c:\Program Files\Tcl\bin).

On my system the tcl installer adds this directory automatically
to the search PATH; if this is not the case on your system, add this
directory manually to your PATH (under NT or Win2K, use: Control
Panel/System/.../Environment; MSDOS-class system use autoexec.bat to
add this directory to the PATH variable by a line like
   SET PATH=c:\Progra~1\Tcl\bin;%PATH%
) and reboot.

Now you should be able now to start the Tcl shell by typing "tclsh83". You
will see the % prompt. To exit the shell, type "exit".

The xotcl*.zip file contains the XOTcl distribution.  Unzip the
contents of the XOTcl zip file on c: to a directory "xotcl*."  Open a
DOS box window and change to the XOTcl win directory, like:

  c:
  cd \xotcl-<VERSION>\win

Next, you have to invoke the installer:

   tclsh83 installWin.tcl

The installer tries to install xotcl in the default directory
"\Program~1\Tcl", which should at least work on English and German
platforms (in English Windows distributions the program directory is
called "Program Files", in German versions, it is called "Programme").

If you want to install XOTcl at a different you can specify the target
directory as an argument of the installer:

  tclsh83 installWin.tcl /Programme/Tcl

Now you should be able to use XOTcl by starting Tclsh and using:

   package require XOTcl; namespace import -force xotcl::*

If XOTcl is not found on your system, you can set the TCLLIBPATH enviornment 
variable to the location of xotcl, e.g.:

  set TCLLIBPATH="C:/PROGRA~1/TCL/lib/xotcl"

Please note the slashes, do not use backslashes here!

You can test your installation with:

XOTcl Tests:
  tclsh xotcl-<VERSION>/tests/testx.xotcl
  tclsh xotcl-<VERSION>/tests/testo.xotcl
  tclsh xotcl-<VERSION>/tests/speedtest.xotcl
  tclsh xotcl-<VERSION>/tests/xocomm.test
  tclsh xotcl-<VERSION>/tests/persistence.test
  tclsh xotcl-<VERSION>/tests/xoRDF.test
