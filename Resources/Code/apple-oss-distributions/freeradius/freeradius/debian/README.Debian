Runlevel Changes
================
In freeradius 1.1.5-1, we changed our update-rc.d call so that we start
at S50 and stop at K19 in order to fix dependency issues with various
databases.  This only takes effect for new installs however.  If you
want to update your existing install to do the same, a quick method is:

update-rc.d -f freeradius remove
update-rc.d freeradius start 50 2 3 4 5 . stop 19 0 1 6 .
