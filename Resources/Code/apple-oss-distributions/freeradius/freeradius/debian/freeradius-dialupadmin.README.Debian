Dialup Admin Debian README
Configuration is in /etc/freeradius-dialupadmin/
which is linked into the dialupadmin tree in
/usr/share/freeradius-dialupadmin.

To put this into production, add
Include /etc/freeradius-dialupadmin/apache2.conf

To the relevant section of your apache configuration.

The scripts make use of .. to access the
other paths, so symlinking into your webtree
may not work.
