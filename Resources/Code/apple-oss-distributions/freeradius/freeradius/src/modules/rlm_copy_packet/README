  This module initializes the Access-Accept packet by copying all of
the attributes from the Access-Request to the Access-Accept.

  It should be listed in the "authorize" section of "radiusd.conf",
probably after "preprocess", but before any other module.


	authorize {
		...

		copy_packet

		...
	}

  It currently takes no configuration, so the sub-section of the
"modules" section should look like:

	modules {
		...

		copy_packet {
		}

		...
	}
