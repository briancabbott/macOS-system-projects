  Other than the make file and rlm_smb.c, these source code in this
directory was taken from pam_smb, version 1.1.6, located at:

http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/

  If there are ANY discrepancies between these files and pam_smb, then
pam_smb SHOULD be taken to be the definitive source code.

rfcnb-util.c has been modified to use FreeRADIUS's ip_getaddr function
which does both inet_addr and gethostbyname{,_r} and returns just the
uint32_t or INADDR_ANY on failure.
