   Description: 
   
   This pass analyzes the evolution of scalar variables in loop
   structures.  The algorithm is based on the SSA representation,
   and on the loop hierarchy tree.  This algorithm is not based on
   the notion of versions of a variable, as it was the case for the
   previous implementations of the scalar evolution algorithm, but
   it assumes that each defined name is unique.

   The notation used in this file is called "chains of recurrences",
   and has been proposed by Eugene Zima, Robert Van Engelen, and
   others for describing induction variables in programs.  For example
   "b -> {0, +, 2}_1" means that the scalar variable "b" is equal to 0
   when entering in the loop_1 and has a step 2 in this loop, in other
   words "for (b = 0; b < N; b+=2);".  Note that the coefficients of
   this chain of recurrence (or chrec [shrek]) can contain the name of
   other variables, in which case they are called parametric chrecs.
   For example, "b -> {a, +, 2}_1" means that the initial value of "b"
   is the value of "a".  In most of the cases these parametric chrecs
   are fully instantiated before their use because symbolic names can
   hide some difficult cases such as self-references described later
   (see the Fibonacci example).
   
   A short sketch of the algorithm is:
     
   Given a scalar variable to be analyzed, follow the SSA edge to
   its definition:
     
   - When the definition is a MODIFY_EXPR: if the right hand side
   (RHS) of the definition cannot be statically analyzed, the answer
   of the analyzer is: "don't know".  
   Otherwise, for all the variables that are not yet analyzed in the
   RHS, try to determine their evolution, and finally try to
   evaluate the operation of the RHS that gives the evolution
   function of the analyzed variable.

   - When the definition is a condition-phi-node: determine the
   evolution function for all the branches of the phi node, and
   finally merge these evolutions (see chrec_merge).

   - When the definition is a loop-phi-node: determine its initial
   condition, that is the SSA edge defined in an outer loop, and
   keep it symbolic.  Then determine the SSA edges that are defined
   in the body of the loop.  Follow the inner edges until ending on
   another loop-phi-node of the same analyzed loop.  If the reached
   loop-phi-node is not the starting loop-phi-node, then we keep
   this definition under a symbolic form.  If the reached
   loop-phi-node is the same as the starting one, then we compute a
   symbolic stride on the return path.  The result is then the
   symbolic chrec {initial_condition, +, symbolic_stride}_loop.

   Examples:
   
   Example 1: Illustration of the basic algorithm.
   
   | a = 3
   | loop_1
   |   b = phi (a, c)
   |   c = b + 1
   |   if (c > 10) exit_loop
   | endloop
   
   Suppose that we want to know the number of iterations of the
   loop_1.  The exit_loop is controlled by a COND_EXPR (c > 10).  We
   ask the scalar evolution analyzer two questions: what's the
   scalar evolution (scev) of "c", and what's the scev of "10".  For
   "10" the answer is "10" since it is a scalar constant.  For the
   scalar variable "c", it follows the SSA edge to its definition,
   "c = b + 1", and then asks again what's the scev of "b".
   Following the SSA edge, we end on a loop-phi-node "b = phi (a,
   c)", where the initial condition is "a", and the inner loop edge
   is "c".  The initial condition is kept under a symbolic form (it
   may be the case that the copy constant propagation has done its
   work and we end with the constant "3" as one of the edges of the
   loop-phi-node).  The update edge is followed to the end of the
   loop, and until reaching again the starting loop-phi-node: b -> c
   -> b.  At this point we have drawn a path from "b" to "b" from
   which we compute the stride in the loop: in this example it is
   "+1".  The resulting scev for "b" is "b -> {a, +, 1}_1".  Now
   that the scev for "b" is known, it is possible to compute the
   scev for "c", that is "c -> {a + 1, +, 1}_1".  In order to
   determine the number of iterations in the loop_1, we have to
   instantiate_parameters ({a + 1, +, 1}_1), that gives after some
   more analysis the scev {4, +, 1}_1, or in other words, this is
   the function "f (x) = x + 4", where x is the iteration count of
   the loop_1.  Now we have to solve the inequality "x + 4 > 10",
   and take the smallest iteration number for which the loop is
   exited: x = 7.  This loop runs from x = 0 to x = 7, and in total
   there are 8 iterations.  In terms of loop normalization, we have
   created a variable that is implicitly defined, "x" or just "_1",
   and all the other analyzed scalars of the loop are defined in
   function of this variable:
   
   a -> 3
   b -> {3, +, 1}_1
   c -> {4, +, 1}_1
     
   or in terms of a C program: 
     
   | a = 3
   | for (x = 0; x <= 7; x++)
   |   {
   |     b = x + 3
   |     c = x + 4
   |   }
     
   Example 2: Illustration of the algorithm on nested loops.
     
   | loop_1
   |   a = phi (1, b)
   |   c = a + 2
   |   loop_2  10 times
   |     b = phi (c, d)
   |     d = b + 3
   |   endloop
   | endloop
     
   For analyzing the scalar evolution of "a", the algorithm follows
   the SSA edge into the loop's body: "a -> b".  "b" is an inner
   loop-phi-node, and its analysis as in Example 1, gives: 
     
   b -> {c, +, 3}_2
   d -> {c + 3, +, 3}_2
     
   Following the SSA edge for the initial condition, we end on "c = a
   + 2", and then on the starting loop-phi-node "a".  From this point,
   the loop stride is computed: back on "c = a + 2" we get a "+2" in
   the loop_1, then on the loop-phi-node "b" we compute the overall
   effect of the inner loop that is "b = c + 30", and we get a "+30"
   in the loop_1.  That means that the overall stride in loop_1 is
   equal to "+32", and the result is: 
     
   a -> {1, +, 32}_1
   c -> {3, +, 32}_1
     
   Example 3: Higher degree polynomials.
     
   | loop_1
   |   a = phi (2, b)
   |   c = phi (5, d)
   |   b = a + 1
   |   d = c + a
   | endloop
     
   a -> {2, +, 1}_1
   b -> {3, +, 1}_1
   c -> {5, +, a}_1
   d -> {5 + a, +, a}_1
     
   instantiate_parameters ({5, +, a}_1) -> {5, +, 2, +, 1}_1
   instantiate_parameters ({5 + a, +, a}_1) -> {7, +, 3, +, 1}_1
     
   Example 4: Lucas, Fibonacci, or mixers in general.
     
   | loop_1
   |   a = phi (1, b)
   |   c = phi (3, d)
   |   b = c
   |   d = c + a
   | endloop
     
   a -> (1, c)_1
   c -> {3, +, a}_1
     
   The syntax "(1, c)_1" stands for a PEELED_CHREC that has the
   following semantics: during the first iteration of the loop_1, the
   variable contains the value 1, and then it contains the value "c".
   Note that this syntax is close to the syntax of the loop-phi-node:
   "a -> (1, c)_1" vs. "a = phi (1, c)".
     
   The symbolic chrec representation contains all the semantics of the
   original code.  What is more difficult is to use this information.
     
   Example 5: Flip-flops, or exchangers.
     
   | loop_1
   |   a = phi (1, b)
   |   c = phi (3, d)
   |   b = c
   |   d = a
   | endloop
     
   a -> (1, c)_1
   c -> (3, a)_1
     
   Based on these symbolic chrecs, it is possible to refine this
   information into the more precise PERIODIC_CHRECs: 
     
   a -> |1, 3|_1
   c -> |3, 1|_1
     
   This transformation is not yet implemented.
     
   Further readings:
   
   You can find a more detailed description of the algorithm in:
   http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~pop/DEA_03_Pop.pdf
   http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~pop/DEA_03_Pop.ps.gz.  But note that
   this is a preliminary report and some of the details of the
   algorithm have changed.  I'm working on a research report that
   updates the description of the algorithms to reflect the design
   choices used in this implementation.
     
   A set of slides show a high level overview of the algorithm and run
   an example through the scalar evolution analyzer:

/* Compute the scalar evolution for EVOLUTION_FN after crossing LOOP.
   In general, in the case of multivariate evolutions we want to get

   | for (j = 0; j < 100; j++)
   |   {
   |     for (k = 0; k < 100; k++)
   |       {

   |      ... = i         - Here the value of i is a function of j. 
   |   }
   | ... = i              - Here the value of i is a scalar.  
   
   Example:  
   
   | i_0 = ...
   | loop_1 10 times
   |   i_1 = phi (i_0, i_2)
   |   i_2 = i_1 + 2

   This loop has the same effect as:

   The overall effect of the loop, "i_0 + 20" in the previous example,

   Description (provided for completeness, for those who read code in
   a plane, and for my poor 62 bytes brain that would have forgotten
   all this in the next two or three months):
   
   The algorithm of translation of programs from the SSA representation
   into the chrecs syntax is based on a pattern matching.  After having
   reconstructed the overall tree expression for a loop, there are only
   two cases that can arise:
   
   1. a = loop-phi (init, a + expr)
   2. a = loop-phi (init, expr)
   
   where EXPR is either a scalar constant with respect to the analyzed
   loop (this is a degree 0 polynomial), or an expression containing
   other loop-phi definitions (these are higher degree polynomials).
   
   Examples:
   
   1. 
   | init = ...
   | loop_1
   |   a = phi (init, a + 5)
   | endloop
   
   2. 
   | inita = ...
   | initb = ...
   | loop_1
   |   a = phi (inita, 2 * b + 3)
   |   b = phi (initb, b + 1)
   | endloop
   
   For the first case, the semantics of the SSA representation is: 
   
   | a (x) = init + \sum_{j = 0}^{x - 1} expr (j)
   
   that is, there is a loop index "x" that determines the scalar value
   of the variable during the loop execution.  During the first
   iteration, the value is that of the initial condition INIT, while
   during the subsequent iterations, it is the sum of the initial
   condition with the sum of all the values of EXPR from the initial
   iteration to the before last considered iteration.  
   
   For the second case, the semantics of the SSA program is:
   
   | a (x) = init, if x = 0;
   |         expr (x - 1), otherwise.
   
   The second case corresponds to the PEELED_CHREC, whose syntax is
   close to the syntax of a loop-phi-node: 
   
   | phi (init, expr)  vs.  (init, expr)_x
   
   The proof of the translation algorithm for the first case is a
   proof by structural induction based on the degree of EXPR.  
   
   Degree 0:
   When EXPR is a constant with respect to the analyzed loop, or in
   other words when EXPR is a polynomial of degree 0, the evolution of
   the variable A in the loop is an affine function with an initial
   condition INIT, and a step EXPR.  In order to show this, we start
   from the semantics of the SSA representation:
   
   f (x) = init + \sum_{j = 0}^{x - 1} expr (j)
   
   and since "expr (j)" is a constant with respect to "j",
   
   f (x) = init + x * expr 
   
   Finally, based on the semantics of the pure sum chrecs, by
   identification we get the corresponding chrecs syntax:
   
   f (x) = init * \binom{x}{0} + expr * \binom{x}{1} 
   f (x) -> {init, +, expr}_x
   
   Higher degree:
   Suppose that EXPR is a polynomial of degree N with respect to the
   analyzed loop_x for which we have already determined that it is
   written under the chrecs syntax:
   
   | expr (x)  ->  {b_0, +, b_1, +, ..., +, b_{n-1}} (x)
   
   We start from the semantics of the SSA program:
   
   | f (x) = init + \sum_{j = 0}^{x - 1} expr (j)
   |
   | f (x) = init + \sum_{j = 0}^{x - 1} 
   |                (b_0 * \binom{j}{0} + ... + b_{n-1} * \binom{j}{n-1})
   |
   | f (x) = init + \sum_{j = 0}^{x - 1} 
   |                \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} (b_k * \binom{j}{k}) 
   |
   | f (x) = init + \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} 
   |                (b_k * \sum_{j = 0}^{x - 1} \binom{j}{k}) 
   |
   | f (x) = init + \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} 
   |                (b_k * \binom{x}{k + 1}) 
   |
   | f (x) = init + b_0 * \binom{x}{1} + ... 
   |              + b_{n-1} * \binom{x}{n} 
   |
   | f (x) = init * \binom{x}{0} + b_0 * \binom{x}{1} + ... 
   |                             + b_{n-1} * \binom{x}{n} 
   |
   
   And finally from the definition of the chrecs syntax, we identify:
   | f (x)  ->  {init, +, b_0, +, ..., +, b_{n-1}}_x 
   
   This shows the mechanism that stands behind the add_to_evolution
   function.  An important point is that the use of symbolic
   parameters avoids the need of an analysis schedule.
   
   Example:
   
   | inita = ...
   | initb = ...
   | loop_1 
   |   a = phi (inita, a + 2 + b)
   |   b = phi (initb, b + 1)
   | endloop
   
   When analyzing "a", the algorithm keeps "b" symbolically:
   
   | a  ->  {inita, +, 2 + b}_1
   
   Then, after instantiation, the analyzer ends on the evolution:
   
   | a  ->  {inita, +, 2 + initb, +, 1}_1
