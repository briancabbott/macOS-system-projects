.Dt AUDIT_WARN 5
.Os "Mac OS X"
.Sh NAME
.Nm audit_warn
.Nd alert when audit daemon issues warnings
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
runs when 
.Xr auditd 8
generates warning messages.  
.Pp
The default 
.Nm
is a script whose first parameter is the type of warning; the script
appends its arguments to 
.Pa /etc/security/audit_messages .
Administrators may replace this script: a more comprehensive one would take
different actions based on the type of warning.  For example, a low-space
warning could result in an email message being sent to the administrator.
