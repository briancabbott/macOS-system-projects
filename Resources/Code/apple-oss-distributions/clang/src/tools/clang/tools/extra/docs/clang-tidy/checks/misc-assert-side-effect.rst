misc-assert-side-effect
=======================


Finds ``assert()`` with side effect.

The condition of ``assert()`` is evaluated only in debug builds so a
condition with side effect can cause different behavior in debug / release
builds.

There are two options:

  - ``AssertMacros``: A comma-separated list of the names of assert macros to
    be checked.
  - ``CheckFunctionCalls``: Whether to treat non-const member and non-member
    functions as they produce side effects. Disabled by default because it
    can increase the number of false positive warnings.
