Notes on building the xdebug extension. This will require the use of autoconf; see IMPORTANT.NOTICE.ON.USE.OF.AUTOCONF.txt.

Install the latest autoconf, on a single machine with restricted access. This is only for use in the phpize step below. Do not use autoconf for any other purpose, and delete it when finished.

Download the source distribution of xdebug from xdebug.org.

Untar the repository; rename it to xdebug.

Run phpize.

Tar up the php-ized soruces; call it xdebug-phpized.tar.gz

Update the Makefile with the xdebug version

The xbs buildit utility should build xdebug as a subproject of apache_mod_php.
