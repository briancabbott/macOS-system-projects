/**
 * Release a gss_OID
 *
 * This function should never be used, this is since many of the
 * gss_OID objects passed around are stack and data objected that are
 * not free-able.
 *
 * The function tries to find internal OIDs that are static and avoid
 * trying to free them.
 *
 * One could guess that gss_name_to_oid() might return an allocated
 * OID.  In this implementation it wont, so there is no need to call
 * gss_release_oid().
 *
 * @param minor_status minor status code returned
 * @param oid oid to be released/freed.
 *
 * @returns GSS major status code
