Abstract

   This document describes the ways in which the GSS-API may be extended
   and directs the creation of IANA registries for GSS-API namespaces
   that may be affected by any extensions.

2.  Introduction

   There is a need for generic and mechanism-specific extensions to the
   Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface
   (GSS-API).  As such extensions are designed and standardized, both at
   the IETF and elsewhere, there is a non-trivial risk of namespace
   pollution and conflicts.  To avoid this we set out guidelines for
   extending the GSS-API and create IANA registries of GSS-API
   namespaces.

3.  Extensions to the GSS-API

   Extensions to the GSS-API can be categorized as follows:
   o  Generic
   o  Implementation-specific
   o  Mechanism-specific
   o  Language binding-specific
   o  Any combination of two or all three of the last three

   Extensions to the GSS-API may be purely semantic, without effect on
   the GSS-API's namespaces.  Or they may introduce new functions,
   constants, types, etc...; these clearly affect the GSS-API
   namespaces.

   Extensions that affect the GSS-API namespaces should be registered
   with the IANA< along with their specific effects on the GSS-API
   namespaces.

4.  Generic GSS-API Namespaces

   All the function, constant and type names, as well as all the
   constant values specified in the base GSS-API specification for the
   basic generic GSS-API namespace.

   The generic GSS-API namespaces are:
   o  Type names
   o  Function names
   o  Constant names for each type
   o  Constant values for each type

5.  Language Binding-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   <Add text; discuss header, module, library, class namespaces and
   whatever else comes up that is language-specific and appropriate for
   registration with the IANA.>

6.  Extension-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   Extensions to the GSS-API may create additional namespaces.  IANA
   registries SHOULD be created for any such new namespaces.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The following registries should be established upon publication of
   this document as an RFC:
   o  GSS-API Type Name Registry
   o  GSS-API Function Name Registry
   o  GSS-API Constant Name Registry
   o  GSS-API Constant Value Registry
   o  GSS-API Class/Header/Library/Module Name Registry

   Entries in these registries should consist of:
   o  Namespace name
   o  Symbol name or prefix, OR value or value range.
   o  [optional] Reference to normative reference for the registration.
   o  [optional] Programming language
   o  [optional] Entry sub-type (e.g., "header name")
   o  [optional] Mechanism OID(s) and/or OID prefix(es) associated with
      the entry
   o  [optional] Magic
   o  [optional] Expert Review (body or people who reviewed the
      registration)
   o  [optional] Description (in English)

   <Add text on guidelines for IANA consideration of registration
   applications, particularly with respect to entries w/o normative
   references, "magic" entries (e.g., special values of 'time' types
   which indicate something other than absolute or relative time, such
   as GSS_C_INDEFINITE), expert review requirements for registrations w/
   o normative references, etc....>
