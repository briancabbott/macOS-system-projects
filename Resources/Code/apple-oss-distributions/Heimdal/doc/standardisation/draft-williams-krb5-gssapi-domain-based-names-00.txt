2.  Domain-Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism


   In accordance with [DOMAIN-BASED-NAMES] this document provides the
   mechanism-specific details needed to implement GSS-API [RFC2743]
   domain-based service names with the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism
   [RFC1964].


   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE name are mapped to Kerberos V principal
   names as follows:
   o  the <service> name becomes the first (0th) component of the
      Kerberos V principal name;
   o  the <domain> name becomes the second component of the Kerberos V
      principal name; if the <domain> name is missing in the GSS name
      then a default domain name MUST be substituted (though no
      mechanism for determining this default is given here; this is an
      implementation-specific detail);
   o  the <hostname>, if present, becomes the third component of the
      Kerberos V principal name;
   o  the realm of the resulting principal name is that which
      corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname, or, if none
      can be determined in this way, then the realm of the hostname, if
      present, and, finally, if that is not possible, the default realm
      for the GSS-API caller.


   The same name canonicalization considerations and methods as used
   elsewhere in the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC1964] and Kerberos
   V [RFC1510] in general apply here.

3.  Examples


   o  "ldap@@ds1.example.tld" may map to "ldap/example.tld/
      ds1.example.tld@EXAMPLE.TLD"
   o  "ldap@example.tld@ds1.example.tld" may map to "ldap/example.tld/
      ds1.example.tld@EXAMPLE.TLD"


   o  "kadmin@@kdc1.example.tld" may map to "kadmin/example.tld/
      kdc1.example.tld@EXAMPLE.TLD"
   o  "kadmin@example.tld@kdc1.example.tld" may map to "kadmin/
      example.tld/kdc1.example.tld@EXAMPLE.TLD"
