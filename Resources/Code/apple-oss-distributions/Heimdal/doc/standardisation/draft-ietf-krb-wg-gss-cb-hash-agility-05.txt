Internet-Draft        Channel Binding Hash Agility         November 2008


Abstract

   Currently, channel bindings are implemented using a MD5 hash in the
   Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Services Application Programming
   Interface (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC4121].  This document updates
   RFC4121 to allow channel bindings using algorithms negotiated based
   on Kerberos crypto framework as defined in RFC3961.  In addition,
   because this update makes use of the last extensible field in the
   Kerberos client-server exchange message, extensions are defined to
   allow future protocol extensions.

Internet-Draft        Channel Binding Hash Agility         November 2008


1.  Introduction

   With the recently discovered weaknesses in the MD5 hash algorithm
   there is a need to use stronger hash algorithms.  Kerberos Version 5
   Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API)
   mechanism [RFC4121] uses MD5 to calculate channel binding verifiers.
   This document specifies an update to the mechanism that allows it to
   create channel binding information based on negotiated algorithms.
   This will allow deploying new algorithms incrementally without break
   interoperability with older implementations, when new attacks arise
   in the future.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "little endian order" is used for brevity to refer to the
   least-significant-octet-first encoding, while the term "big endian
   order" is for the most-significant-octet-first encoding.

3.  Channel binding hash agility

   When generating a channel binding verifier, Bnd, a hash is computed
   from the channel binding fields.  Initiators MUST populate the Bnd
   field in order to maintain interoperability with existing acceptors.
   In addition, initiators MUST populate the extension field, Exts.  All
   fields before "Exts" do not change from what is described in
   [RFC4121], they are listed for convenience.  The 0x8003 GSS checksum
   MUST have the following structure:

      Octet     Name       Description
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      0..3      Lgth       Number of octets in Bnd field;  Represented
                            in little-endian order;  Currently contains
                            hex value 10 00 00 00 (16).
      4..19     Bnd        Channel binding information, as described in
                            section 4.1.1.2 [RFC4121].
      20..23    Flags      Four-octet context-establishment flags in
                            little-endian order as described in section
                            4.1.1.1 [RFC4121].
      24..25    DlgOpt     The delegation option identifier (=1) in
                            little-endian order [optional].  This field
                            and the next two fields are present if and
                            only if GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG is set as described
                            in section 4.1.1.1 [RFC4121].
      26..27    Dlgth      The length of the Deleg field in
                            little-endian order [optional].
      28..(n-1) Deleg      KRB_CRED message (n = Dlgth + 28) [optional].
      n..last   Exts       Extensions

      where Exts is the concatenation of zero, one or more individual
      extensions, each of which consists of, in order:

        type -- big endian order unsigned integer, 32-bits, which
                contains the type of extension
        length -- big endian order unsigned integer, 32-bits, which
                contains the length, in octets, of the extension data
                encoded as an array of octets immediately following this
                field
        data -- octet string of extension information
      in that order

      If multiple extensions are present then there MUST be at most one
      instance of a given extension type.

   When channel binding is used the Exts MUST include the following
   extension:

      data-type 0x00000000

      data-value

         The output obtained by applying the Kerberos V get_mic()
         operation [RFC3961], using the sub-session key from the
         authenticator and key usage number 43, to the channel binding
         data as described in [RFC4121], section 4.1.1.2 (using get_mic
         instead of MD5).

   Initiators that are unwilling to use a MD5 hash of the channel
   bindings MUST set the Bnd field to sixteen octets of hex value FF.

4.  Security considerations

   Initiators do not know if the acceptor had ignored channel bindings
   or whether it validated the MD5 hash of the channel bindings
   [RFC4121].

   Ultimately, it is up to the application whether to use channel
   binding or not.  This is dependent upon the security policy of these
   applications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is hereby requested to create a new registry of "Kerberos V
   GSS-API mechanism extension types" with four-field entries (type
   number, type name, description, and normative reference) and,
   initially, a single registration: 0x00000000, "Channel Binding MIC,"
   "Extension for the verifier of the channel bindings," <this RFC>.

   Using the guidelines for allocation as described in [RFC5226], type
   number assignments are as follows:

      0x00000000 - 0x000003FF IETF Consensus

      0x00000400 - 0xFFFFF3FF Specification Required

      0xFFFFF400 - 0xFFFFFFFF Private Use
