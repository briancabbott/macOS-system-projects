Abstract

   This document describes domainname-based service principal names and
   the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API).

   Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names,
   but using a domain name (not necessarily and Internat domain name)
   instead of or in addition to a hostname.  The primary purpose of
   domain-based service names is to provide a way to name clustered
   services after the domain which they service, thereby allowing their

   clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication of
   their names.

2.  Introduction

   The use of hostbased principal names for domain-wide services
   presents the problem of how to distinguish between an instance of a
   hostbased service that is authorized to respond for a domain and one
   that isn't.

   Consider LDAP.  LDAP [RFC3377] with SASL [RFC2222] and the Kerberos V
   mechanism [RFC1964] for the GSS-API [RFC2743] uses a hostbased
   principal with a service name of "ldap", a reasonable approach,
   provided there is only one logical LDAP directory in a Kerberos
   realm's domain, and that all ldap servers in that realm serve that
   one LDAP directory.  If there were other LDAP directories, then
   clients could not tell which service is authorized to serve which
   directory, not without assuming a secure method for finding LDAP
   servers (e.g., DNSSEC).  This is a significant, and oft-unstated
   restriction on users of LDAP.

   Domain based names can eliminate this problem by allowing LDAP
   service names to indicate which LDAP directory they are authorized to
   serve.

   A domain-based name consists of three required elements:

   o  a service name

   o  a domain name

   o  a hostname

3.  Name Type OID and Symbolic Name

   The new name type has an OID of

      [NOTE: OID assignment to be made with IANA.]

      {iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) nametypes(6) gss-
      domain-based(5)}

   The recommended symbolic name for this GSS-API name type is
   "GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE".

4.  Query and Display Syntaxes

   There is a single name syntax for domain-based names.

   The syntax is:

      domain-based-name :=

         | <service> '@' <domain> '@' <hostname>

   Note that for Internet domain names the trailing '.' is not and MUST
   NOT be included in the domain name (or hostname) parts of the display
   form GSS-API domain-based MNs.

6.  Security Considerations

   Use of GSS-API domain-based names may not be negotiable by some GSS-
   API mechanisms, and some acceptors may not support GSS-API domain-
   based names.  In such cases initiators are left to fallback on the
   use of hostbased names, in which case the initiators MUST also verify
   that the acceptor's hostbased name is authorized to provide the given
   service for the domain that the initiator had wanted.

   The above security consideration also applies to all GSS-API
   initiators who lack support for domain-based service names.
