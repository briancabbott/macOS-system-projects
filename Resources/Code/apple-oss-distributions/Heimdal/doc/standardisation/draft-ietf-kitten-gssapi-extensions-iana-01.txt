Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions             October 2005


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   There is a need for generic and mechanism-specific extensions to the
   Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
   API).  As such extensions are designed and standardized, both at the
   IETF and elsewhere, there is a non-trivial risk of namespace
   pollution and conflicts.  To avoid this we set out guidelines for
   extending the GSS-API and create IANA registries of GSS-API
   namespaces.

   The registration of name prefixes and constant value ranges is
   allowed so as to save the IANA the trouble of registering every GSS-
   API name and constant, and to allow for reservation of portions of
   some GSS namespaces for private extensions or extensions which lack
   IETF Standards-Track extensions.


3.  Extensions to the GSS-API

   Extensions to the GSS-API can be categorized as follows:
   o  Generic
   o  Implementation-specific
   o  Mechanism-specific
   o  Language binding-specific
   o  Any combination of two or all three of the last three

   Extensions to the GSS-API may be purely semantic, without effect on
   the GSS-API's namespaces.  Or they may introduce new functions,
   constants, types, etc...; these clearly affect the GSS-API
   namespaces.

   Extensions that affect the GSS-API namespaces should be registered
   with the IANA.


4.  Generic GSS-API Namespaces

   All the function, constant and type names, as well as all the
   constant values specified in the base GSS-API specification for the
   basic generic GSS-API namespace.

Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions             October 2005


   The generic GSS-API namespaces are:
   o  Type names
   o  Function names
   o  Constant names for each type
   o  Constant values for each type
   o  Mechanism OIDs
   o  Name Type OIDs
   o  Mechanism Attribute OIDs (see [EXTENDED-INQUIRY])


5.  Language Binding-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   <Add text; discuss header, module, library, class, method namespaces
   and whatever else comes up that is language-specific and appropriate
   for registration with the IANA.>


6.  Extension-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   Extensions to the GSS-API may create additional namespaces.
   Instructions to the IANA should included for the handling of such
   namespaces.


7.  Registration Form(s)

   Registrations for GSS-API namespaces SHALL take the following form:

   <TBD>

   The IANA should create a single GSS-API namespace registry, or
   multiple registries, one for symbolic names and one for constant
   values, or it may create a registry per-programming language, at its
   convenience.

   Entries in these registries should consist of all the fields from
   their corresponding registration entries.

   Entries SHOULD be sorted by object type, proggamming language, symbol
   name.

   <Add text on guidelines for IANA consideration of registration
   applications, particularly with respect to entries lacking normative
   references, "magic" entries (e.g., special values of 'time' types
   which indicate something other than absolute or relative time, such
   as GSS_C_INDEFINITE), expert review requirements (if any) for
   registrations lacking normative references, etc....>

8.  Initial Namespace Registrations

   <Add registration entries for namespaces (name prefixes) for RFC2743/
   RFC2744/RFC2853.>

   <Add registration entries for private namespaces (name prefixes) for
   implementation- and/or platform-specific extensions.>


9.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.
