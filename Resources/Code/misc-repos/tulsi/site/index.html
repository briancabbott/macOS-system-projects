      <p>Tulsi integrates <a href="https://bazel.build">Bazel</a> (Google's build tool) with Apple's
        Xcode IDE.
      </p>
      <p>Tulsi is currently in Beta but is broadly used within Google. There are still some
         functional limitations, but we believe that Tulsi is stable enough for production use. The
         Tulsi team monitors and responds actively to bug reports from users.
