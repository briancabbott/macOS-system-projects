#  Self-sizing Child Views

This project is an example of using the `UIContentContainer` protocol to allow a child view controller to tell its parent its preferred content size.

See the following blog post for more details:

See the second example in the folder `DynamicContainer-v2` for an example of how to achieve the same effect without using the preferred content size.
