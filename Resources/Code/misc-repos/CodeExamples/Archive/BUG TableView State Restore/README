Restore - State Preservation and Restoration of Table View

Version 1.0     07 April 2013   Initial version.
=======================================================================

This is a example project to reproduce a bug in the iOS 6 state preservation
and restoration code. The state of a table view is not restored when the table
is embedded in a navigation controller.

The project contains two storyboards to demonstrate state restoration of a table
view both when it is the root view and when it is embedded in a navigation
controller:

If the Target settings are used to set the Main Storyboad to NavStoryboard the 
user inteface consists of UITableView embedded in a Navigation Controller. In 
this use case the table view state is not restored.

If the Target settings are used to set the Main Storyboard to MainStoryboard the 
user interface consists of a single UITableView which does have state restored 
as expected.
