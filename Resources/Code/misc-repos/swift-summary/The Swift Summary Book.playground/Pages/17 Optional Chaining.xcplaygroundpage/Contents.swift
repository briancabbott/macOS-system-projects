/*
 ========================================================
 Optional Chaining as an Alternative to Forced Unwrapping
 ========================================================
 */

/*
 The main difference is that optional chaining fails gracefully when the optional is nil,
 whereas forced unwrapping triggers a runtime error when the optional is nil.
 
 The result of an optional chaining call is always an optional value, even if the property,
 method, or subscript you are querying returns a nonoptional value.
 
 Specifically, the result of an optional chaining call is of the same type as
 the expected return value, but wrapped in an optional.
