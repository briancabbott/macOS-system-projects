Full details and usage instructions can be found [here](https://objective-see.com/products/whatsyoursign.html). 

**To Build**<br>
WhatsYourSign should build cleanly in Xcode (though you will have to remove code signing constraints, or replace with your own Apple developer/kernel code signing certificate).
