# Do Not Disturb

'Do Not Disturb' (DnD) is a free open-source security tool for macOS that aims to detect unauthorized physical access to your laptop!
Full details and usage instructions can be found [here](https://objective-see.com/products/dnd.html). 

**To Build**<br>
DnD should build cleanly in Xcode (though you will have to remove code signing constraints, or replace with your own Apple developer signing certificate).

**To Install**<br>
Build or [download](https://bitbucket.org/objective-see/deploy/downloads/DoNotDisturb_1.0.0.zip) the pre-built installer application. Install, by simply running the installer (UI) application.
