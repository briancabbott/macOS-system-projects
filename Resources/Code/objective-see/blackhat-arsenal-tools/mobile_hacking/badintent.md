# BadIntent

### Description
BadIntent integrates Android's Binder framework with Burp Suite. It enables pentesters to use the typical Burp Suite workflow and all of its tools and extensions. BadIntent helps in identifying vulnerabilities, makes AIDL-attacks more easy to perform and assists in attacks against backends. Since Binder transactions are hooked, it is possible to analyze, interrupt, modify and repeat most communication channels and exchanged messages. This can be used for reverse engineering and obfuscation bypass activities.
