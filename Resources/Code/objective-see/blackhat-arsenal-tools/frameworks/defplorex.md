# DefPloreX

### Description
An Elasticsearch-based toolkit that our team uses for large-scale processing, analysis and visualization of e-crime records. In particular, we've successfully been applying DefPloreX to the analysis of deface records (e.g., from web compromises); hence its name, Def(acement) eXPlorer (DefPloreX).

The full version of DefPloreX includes:

  * A thin wrapper to interact with an Elasticsearch backend (included in this release)
  * A distributed data-processing pipeline based on Celery (example included in this release)
  * An analysis component to extract information from deface web pages
  * A features extraction component to produce a compact, numerical and categorical representation of each web page
  * A statistical machine-learning component to automatically find groups of similar web pages

The input to DefPloreX is a feed of URLs describing the deface web pages,
including metadata such as the (declared) attacker name, timestamp, reason
for hacking that page, and so on. Separately, we also have a mirror of the
web pages at the time of compromise.
