# Yasuo

### Description
Yasuo is a ruby script that scans for vulnerable 3rd-party web applications.

While working on a network security assessment (internal, external, red team gigs etc.), we often come across vulnerable 3rd-party web applications or web front-ends that allow us to compromise the remote server by exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities. Some of the common & favorite applications are Apache Tomcat administrative interface, JBoss jmx-console, Hudson Jenkins and so on.

If you search through Exploit-db, there are over 10,000 remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that exist in tons of web applications/front-ends and could allow an attacker to completely compromise the back-end server. These vulnerabilities range from RCE to malicious file uploads to SQL injection to RFI/LFI etc.

Yasuo is built to quickly scan the network for such vulnerable applications thus serving pwnable targets on a silver platter.
