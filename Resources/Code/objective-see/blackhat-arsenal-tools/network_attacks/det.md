# DET

### Description
DET aims to provide a framework to assist with exfiltrating data using either one or several channels. Social media has become extremely popular in recent attacks such as HammerToss, campaign uncovered by FireEye in July 2015. Several tools are also publicly available allowing you to remotely access computers through "legitimate" services such as Gmail (GCat) or Twitter (Twittor). Often gaining access to a network is just the first step for a targeted attacker. Once inside, the goal is to go after sensitive information and exfiltrate it to servers under their control. To prevent this from occuring, a whole industry has popped up with the aim of stopping exfiltration attacks. However, often these are expensive and rarely work as expected. With this in mind, I created the Data Exfiltration Toolkit (DET) to help both penetration testers testing deployed security devices and those admins who've installed and configured them, to ensure they are working as expected and detecting when sensitive data is leaving the network.
