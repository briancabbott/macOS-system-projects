# Ox4Shell

### Description
Since the release of the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), many tools were created to obfuscate Log4Shell payloads, making the lives of security engineers a nightmare.

Threat actors tend to apply obfuscation techniques to their payloads for several reasons. Most security protection tools, such as web application firewalls (WAFs), rely on rules to match malicious patterns. By using obfuscated payloads, threat actors are able to circumvent the rules logic and bypass security measures. Moreover, obfuscated payloads increase analysis complexity and, depending upon the degree of obfuscation, can also prevent them from being reverse-engineered.

Decoding and analyzing obfuscated payloads is time-consuming and often results in inaccurate data. However, doing so is crucial for understanding attackers' intentions.

We believe that security teams around the world can benefit from using Ox4Shell to dramatically reduce their analysis time. To help the security community, we have decided to release Ox4Shell - a payload deobfuscation tool that would make your life much easier.
