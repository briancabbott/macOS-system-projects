# Lazyrecon v2.0

### Description
Lazyrecon v2.0 is a wicked sick bash script, CI/CD ready subdomain discovery tool that finds and resolves valid subdomains then performs SSRF/LFI/SQLi fuzzing and port scanning. It has a simple modular architecture and is optimized for speed while working with GitHub and a Wayback machine.
