# SniffMK

### Description
SniffMK is a simple utility designed to sniff mouse and keyboard events on macOS. It is based on code from Amit Singh's [website](http://osxbook.com)

SniffMK was designed to facilitate malware analysis (specifically OSX/FruitFly which can simulate both mouse and keyboard events) See BlackHat/DefCon [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/patrickwardle/fruitfly-via-a-custom-c-and-c-server?slide=18) for details.
