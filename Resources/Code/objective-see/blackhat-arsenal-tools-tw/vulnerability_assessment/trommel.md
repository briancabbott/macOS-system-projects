# TROMMEL

### Description
TROMMEL sifts through embedded device files to identify potential vulnerable indicators. <br />

TROMMEL identifies the following indicators related to: 
* Secure Shell (SSH) key files
* Secure Socket Layer (SSL) key files
* Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
* Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
* email addresses
* shell scripts
* web server binaries
* configuration files
* database files
* specific binaries files (i.e. Dropbear, BusyBox, etc.) 
* shared object library files
* web application scripting variables, and 
* Android application package (APK) file permissions. 

TROMMEL has also integrated [vFeed](https://vfeed.io/) which allows for further in-depth vulnerability analysis of identified indicators. <br />

TROMMEL was written with the intent to help with identifying indicators that may contain vulnerabilities found in firmware of embedded devices. <br/>
