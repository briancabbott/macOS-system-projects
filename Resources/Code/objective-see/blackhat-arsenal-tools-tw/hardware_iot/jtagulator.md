# JTAGulator

### Description
JTAGulator is an open source hardware hacking tool that assists in identifying on-chip debug interfaces from test points, vias, or component pads on a target device. The tool can save a tremendous amount of time during reverse engineering, particularly for those who don't have the resources required for traditional processes.
