### Description
Python Multi Threaded Tor Proxy,  
Did you ever want to be at two different places at the same time?  
When I asked myself this question, I actually started developing this solution in my mind.  
While performing penetration tests there are often problems caused by security devices that block the "attacking" IP.  
This really annoyed me, so I wrote a script to supply a solution for this problem.  
With a large number of IP addresses performing the attacks, better results are guaranteed - especially when attempting attacks to bypass Web Application Firewalls, Brute-Force type attacks and many more.
