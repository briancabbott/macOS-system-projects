FHIRModels is a Swift library for [FHIR¬Æ][fhir] resource data models.

## Features

- Native Swift representation of FHIR resources, elements and data types
- Separate targets for DSTU2, STU3, R4 and latest build versions
- Enforced non-nullability of mandatory parameters
- Enums for most closed code systems
- Enums to support value[x] types
- Date/Time parsing, validation and conversion to and from NSDate
- Swift Codable support

## Requirements

FHIRModels works with Swift 5.1 and newer. Running unit tests requires Swift 5.3 and newer.

## Installation

[Swift Package Manager][spm] is the recommended way to add FHIRModels to your project:

1. In Xcode 11 and newer, go to ‚ÄúFile‚Äù ¬ª ‚ÄúSwift Package Management‚Äù ¬ª ‚ÄúAdd Package Dependency...‚Äù
2. Search for ‚ÄúFHIRModels‚Äù in the panel that comes up or paste the full URL to the GitHub repository, then select the package
3. Pick the versioning that best works for you (usually the current version and ‚Äúup to next major‚Äù)
4. In order to update the dependency, periodically select ‚ÄúUpdate to Latest Package Versions‚Äù from Xcode 11's ‚ÄúFile‚Äù ¬ª ‚ÄúSwift Package Management‚Äù menu

Alternatively, you can add FHIRModels to your `Package.swift` file as a dependency:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels.git",
            .upToNextMajor(from: "0.2.0"))
]
```

Usage
=====

## Instantiate FHIR Models

Assuming you have data that you know represents a FHIR resource, you have two options of instantiating a model. We'll assume you have JSON data for the examples below.

### 1. Use ResourceProxy

The `ResourceProxy` type inspects the `resourceType` in the data and instantiates the appropriate class for you:

```swift
import ModelsR4

let data = <FHIR JSON data>
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
do {
    let proxy = try decoder.decode(ResourceProxy.self, from: data)
    
    let resource = proxy.get()
    // `resource` is a generic `Resource`
    
    let patient = proxy.get(if: Patient.self)
    // `patient` is a nullable `Patient`
    
    if case .patient(let patient) = proxy {
        // `patient` is a `Patient`
    }
    
    switch proxy {
    case .patient(let patient):
        // `patient` is a `Patient`
        break
    default:
        break
    }
} catch {
    print("Failed to instantiate: \(error)")
}
```

### 2. Decode to known Resource

If you think you know the correct resource type already:

```swift
import ModelsR4

let data = <FHIR JSON data>
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
do {
    let resource = try decoder.decode(Patient.self, from: data)
} catch {
    print("Failed to instantiate Patient: \(error)")
}
```

### 3. Get resources from Bundle

To get certain resources from a `Bundle` you can do:

```swift
import ModelsR4

let data = <FHIR JSON data>
let bundle = try JSONDecoder().decode(ModelsR4.Bundle.self, from: data)
let observations = bundle.entry?.compactMap {
    $0.resource?.get(if: ModelsR4.Observation.self)
}
// observations is an array of `Observation` instances
```

## Model Properties

FHIR Resource and Element types are represented as Swift classes,
primitive data types are represented as structs.
All primitives are defined as `FHIRPrimitive`,
genericized to the appropriate type such as `FHIRBool` or `DateTime`.

### Patient with a name

The library makes extensive use of `ExpressibleBy{Type}Literal` so you can take shortcuts when instantiating primitives.
For example, `HumanName.given` is an Array of `FHIRPrimitive<FHIRString>` that can be instantiated as follows:

```swift
import ModelsR4

let name = HumanName(family: "Altick", given: ["Kelly"])
let patient = Patient(name: [name])

name.given?.first                   // FHIRPrimitive<FHIRString>?
name.given?.first?.value            // FHIRString?
name.given?.first?.value?.string    // String?
```

### Working with primitives

You may be tempted to get the Swift native types from primitive values and pass these around.
To get a String from the resource ID you would do:

```swift
let id = resource.id?.value?.string
```

Instead, consider passing the element around in its full form, in this case as `FHIRPrimitive<FHIRString>`.
This means you will not lose extensions while you can still use some primitives in code as if they were native types.
With `FHIRPrimitive<FHIRString>` for example, you can actually do:

```swift
if resource.id == "101" {
    
}
```

Conversely, you can also assign many `FHIRPrimitive` types with String, Bool or numeric literals, for example:

```swift
let patient = Patient(...)
patient.id = "101"
patient.active = true
```

Lastly, many Swift native types have been extended to offer an `asFHIR{type}Primitive()` method. URL and String for example offer:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "http://apple.com")!.asFHIRURIPrimitive()
// url is a `FHIRPrimitive<FHIRURI>`
let str = "http://hl7.org/fhir".asFHIRURIPrimitive()
// str is a `FHIRPrimitive<FHIRURI>?`
```

### Date & Time

FHIRModels handles date/time ‚ÜîÔ∏é string conversion transparently and will discard invalid dates.

```swift
do {
    let dateTimeString = "2020-03-12T12:33:54.6543-06:00"
    let dateTime = try DateTime(dateTimeString)
    dateTime.date.year == 2020
    dateTime.time.minute == 33
    dateTime.timeZone == TimeZone(secondsFromGMT: -6 * 3600)
} catch {
    print("Failed to parse date time string: \(error)")
}
```
