## SwiftUI-compatible framework for building browser apps with WebAssembly

[![CI status](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/780838335798706197?label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/ashJW8T8yp)

At the moment Tokamak implements a very basic subset of SwiftUI. Its DOM renderer supports a few
view types and modifiers (you can check the current list in [the progress
document](docs/progress.md)), and a new `HTML` view for constructing arbitrary HTML. The long-term
goal of Tokamak is to implement as much of SwiftUI API as possible and to provide a few more helpful
additions that simplify HTML and CSS interactions.

If there's some SwiftUI API that's missing but you'd like to use it, please review the existing
[issues](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/issues) and
[PRs](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/pulls) to get more details about the current status, or
[create a new issue](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/issues/new) to let us prioritize the
development based on the demand. We also try to make the development of views and modifiers easier
(with the help from the `HTML` view, see [the example
below](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak#arbitrary-html)), so pull requests are very welcome!
Don't forget to check [the "Contributing"
section](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak#contributing) first.

If you'd like to participate in the growing [SwiftWasm](https://swiftwasm.org) community, you're
also very welcome to join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/ashJW8T8yp), or the `#webassembly`
channel in [the SwiftPM Slack](https://swift-package-manager.herokuapp.com/).

### Example code

Tokamak API attempts to resemble SwiftUI API as much as possible. The main difference is
that you use `import TokamakShim` instead of `import SwiftUI` in your files. The former makes
your views compatible with Apple platforms, as well as platforms supported by Tokamak (currently
only WebAssembly/[WASI](https://wasi.dev/) with more coming in the future):

```swift
import TokamakShim

struct Counter: View {
  @State var count: Int
  let limit: Int

  var body: some View {
    if count < limit {
      VStack {
        Button("Increment") { count += 1 }
        Text("\(count)")
      }
      .onAppear { print("Counter.VStack onAppear") }
      .onDisappear { print("Counter.VStack onDisappear") }
    } else {
      VStack { Text("Limit exceeded") }
    }
  }
}

@main
struct CounterApp: App {
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup("Counter Demo") {
      Counter(count: 5, limit: 15)
    }
  }
}
```

### Arbitrary HTML

With the `HTML` view you can also render any HTML you want, including inline SVG:

```swift
struct SVGCircle: View {
  var body: some View {
    HTML("svg", ["width": "100", "height": "100"]) {
      HTML("circle", [
        "cx": "50", "cy": "50", "r": "40",
        "stroke": "green", "stroke-width": "4", "fill": "yellow",
      ])
    }
  }
}
```

`HTML` doesn't support event listeners, and is declared in the `TokamakStaticHTML` module, which `TokamakDOM` re-exports. The benefit of `HTML` is that you can use it for static rendering in libraries like [TokamakVapor](https://github.com/TokamakUI/TokamakVapor) and [TokamakPublish](https://github.com/TokamakUI/TokamakPublish).

Another option is the `DynamicHTML` view provided by the `TokamakDOM` module, which has a `listeners` property with a corresponding initializer parameter. You can pass closures that can handle `onclick`, `onmouseover` and other DOM events for you in the `listeners` dictionary. Check out [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers) for the full list.

An example of mouse events handling with `DynamicHTML` would look like this:

```swift
struct MouseEventsView: View {
  @State var position: CGPoint = .zero
  @State var isMouseButtonDown: Bool = false

  var body: some View {
    DynamicHTML(
      "div",
      ["style": "width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: red;"],
      listeners: [
        "mousemove": { event in
          guard
            let x = event.offsetX.jsValue().number,
            let y = event.offsetY.jsValue().number
          else { return }

          position = CGPoint(x: x, y: y)
        },
        "mousedown": { _ in isMouseButtonDown = true },
        "mouseup": { _ in isMouseButtonDown = false },
      ]
    ) {
      Text("position is \(position), is mouse button down? \(isMouseButtonDown)")
    }
  }
}
```

### Arbitrary styles and scripts

While [`JavaScriptKit`](https://github.com/swiftwasm/JavaScriptKit) is a great option for occasional interactions with JavaScript,
sometimes you need to inject arbitrary scripts or styles, which can be done through direct
DOM access:

```swift
import JavaScriptKit

let document = JSObject.global.document
let script = document.createElement("script")
script.setAttribute("src", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.27.0/moment.min.js")
document.head.appendChild(script)

_ = document.head.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", #"""
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css">
"""#)
```

This way both [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) styles and [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
localized date formatting (or any arbitrary style/script/font added that way) are available in your
app.

## Requirements

### For app developers

- macOS 11 and Xcode 13.0 or later. Xcode 13.2 or later is recommended if you're developing
multi-platform apps that target WebAssembly and macOS at the same time, as these versions support
Swift concurrency back-deployment.
- [Swift 5.4 or later](https://swift.org/download/) and Ubuntu 18.04 if you'd like to use Linux.
  Other Linux distributions are currently not supported.

### For users of apps depending on Tokamak

Any recent browser that [supports WebAssembly](https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm) and [required
JavaScript features](https://caniuse.com/?search=finalizationregistry) should work, which currently includes:

- Edge 84+
- Firefox 79+
- Chrome 84+
- Desktop Safari 14.1+
- Mobile Safari 14.8+

If you need to support older browser versions, you'll have to build with
`JAVASCRIPTKIT_WITHOUT_WEAKREFS` flag, passing `-Xswiftc -DJAVASCRIPTKIT_WITHOUT_WEAKREFS` flags
when compiling. This should lower browser requirements to these versions:

- Edge 16+
- Firefox 61+
- Chrome 66+
- (Mobile) Safari 12+

Not all of these versions are tested on regular basis though, compatibility reports are very welcome!

## Getting started

Tokamak relies on [`carton`](https://carton.dev) as a primary build tool. As a part of these steps
you'll install `carton` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS (unfortunately you'll have to build
it manually on Linux). Assuming you already have Homebrew installed, you can create a new Tokamak
app by following these steps:

1. Install `carton`:

```
brew install swiftwasm/tap/carton
```

If you had `carton` installed before this, make sure you have version 0.12.0 or greater:

```
carton --version
```

2. Create a directory for your project and make it current:

```
mkdir TokamakApp && cd TokamakApp
```

3. Initialize the project from a template with `carton`:

```
carton init --template tokamak
```

4. Build the project and start the development server, `carton dev` can be kept running
   during development:

```
carton dev
```

5. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) in your browser to see the app
   running. You can edit the app source code in your favorite editor and save it, `carton`
   will immediately rebuild the app and reload all browser tabs that have the app open.

You can also clone this repository and run `carton dev --product TokamakDemo` in its root
directory. This will build the demo app that shows almost all of the currently implemented APIs.

## Security

By default, the DOM renderer will escape HTML control characters in `Text` views. If you wish
to override this functionality, you can use the `_domTextSanitizer` modifier:

```swift
Text("<font color='red'>Unsanitized Text</font>")
  ._domTextSanitizer(Sanitizers.HTML.insecure)
```

You can also use custom sanitizers; the argument to `_domTextSanitizer` is simply a
`String -> String` closure. If `_domTextSanitizer` is applied to a non-`Text` view,
it will apply to all `Text` in subviews, unless overridden.

If you use user-generated or otherwise unsafe strings elsewhere, make sure to properly
sanitize them yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### `unable to find utility "xctest"` error when building

This error can only happen on macOS, so make sure you have Xcode installed as listed [in the
requirements](#requirements-for-app-developers). If you do have Xcode installed but still get the
error, please refer to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61725799/442427).

### Syntax highlighting and autocomplete don't work in Xcode

Open `Package.swift` of your project that depends on Tokamak with Xcode and build it for macOS.
As Xcode currently doesn't support cross-compilation for non-Apple platforms, your project can't
be indexed if it doesn't build for macOS, even if it isn't fully function on macOS when running.
If you need to exclude some WebAssembly-specific code in your own app that doesn't compile on macOS,
you can rely on `#if os(WASI)` compiler directives.

All relevant modules of Tokamak (including `TokamakDOM`) should compile on macOS. You may see issues
with `TokamakShim` on macOS Catalina, where relevant SwiftUI APIs aren't supported, but replacing
`import TokamakShim` with `import TokamakDOM` should resolve the issue until you're able to update
to macOS Big Sur.

If you stumble upon code in Tokamak that doesn't build on macOS and prevents syntax highlighting or
autocomplete from working in Xcode, please [report it as a
bug](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak/issues/new).

### Syntax highlighting and autocomplete don't work in VSCode

Make sure you have [the SourceKit LSP
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pvasek.sourcekit-lsp--dev-unofficial)
installed. If you don't trust this unofficial release, please follow [the manual building and
installation guide](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/tree/main/Editors/vscode). Apple currently
doesn't provide an official build of the extension on the VSCode Marketplace unfortunately.
