# `Renderers` in Tokamak

**Author: [@carson-katri](https://github.com/carson-katri)**

Tokamak is a flexible library. `TokamakCore` provides the SwiftUI API, which your `Renderer` can use
to construct a representation of `Views` that your platform understands.

To explain the creation of `Renderers`, weâ€™ll be creating a simple one: `TokamakStaticHTML` (which
you can find in the `Tokamak` repository).

Before we create the `Renderer`, we need to understand the requirements of our platform:

1. Stateful apps cannot be created. This simplifies the scope of our project, as we only have to
   render once. However, if you are building a `Renderer` that supports state changes, the process
   is largely the same. `TokamakCore`â€™s `StackReconciler` will let your `Renderer` know when a
   `View` has to be redrawn.
2. HTML should be rendered. `TokamakDOM` provides HTML representations of many `Views`, so we can
   utilize it. However, we will cover how to provide custom `View` bodies your `Renderer` can
   understand, and when you are required to do so.

And thatâ€™s it! In the next part weâ€™ll go more in depth on `Renderers`.

## Understanding `Renderers`

So, what goes into a `Renderer`?

1. A `Target` - Targets are the destination for rendered `Views`. For instance, on iOS this is
   `UIView`, on macOS an `NSView`, and on the web we render to DOM nodes.
2. A `StackReconciler` - The reconciler does all the heavy lifting to understand the view tree. It
   notifies your `Renderer` of what views need to be mounted/unmounted.
3. `func mountTarget`- This function is called when a new target instance should be created and
   added to the parent (either as a subview or some other way, e.g. installed if itâ€™s a layout
   constraint).
4. `func update` - This function is called when an existing target instance should be updated (e.g.
   when `State` changes).
5. `func unmount` - This function is called when an existing target instance should be unmounted:
   removed from the parent and most likely destroyed.

Thatâ€™s it! Letâ€™s get our project set up.

## `TokamakStaticHTML` Setup

Every `Renderer` can choose what `Views`, `ViewModifiers`, property wrappers, etc. are available to
use. A `Core.swift` file is used to re-export these symbols. For `TokamakStaticHTML`, weâ€™ll use the
following `Core.swift` file:

```swift
import TokamakCore

// MARK: Environment & State

public typealias Environment = TokamakCore.Environment

// MARK: Modifiers & Styles

public typealias ViewModifier = TokamakCore.ViewModifier
public typealias ModifiedContent = TokamakCore.ModifiedContent

public typealias DefaultListStyle = TokamakCore.DefaultListStyle
public typealias PlainListStyle = TokamakCore.PlainListStyle
public typealias InsetListStyle = TokamakCore.InsetListStyle
public typealias GroupedListStyle = TokamakCore.GroupedListStyle
public typealias InsetGroupedListStyle = TokamakCore.InsetGroupedListStyle

// MARK: Shapes

public typealias Shape = TokamakCore.Shape

public typealias Capsule = TokamakCore.Capsule
public typealias Circle = TokamakCore.Circle
public typealias Ellipse = TokamakCore.Ellipse
public typealias Path = TokamakCore.Path
public typealias Rectangle = TokamakCore.Rectangle
public typealias RoundedRectangle = TokamakCore.RoundedRectangle

// MARK: Primitive values

public typealias Color = TokamakCore.Color
public typealias Font = TokamakCore.Font

public typealias CGAffineTransform = TokamakCore.CGAffineTransform
public typealias CGPoint = TokamakCore.CGPoint
public typealias CGRect = TokamakCore.CGRect
public typealias CGSize = TokamakCore.CGSize

// MARK: Views

public typealias Divider = TokamakCore.Divider
public typealias ForEach = TokamakCore.ForEach
public typealias GridItem = TokamakCore.GridItem
public typealias Group = TokamakCore.Group
public typealias HStack = TokamakCore.HStack
public typealias LazyHGrid = TokamakCore.LazyHGrid
public typealias LazyVGrid = TokamakCore.LazyVGrid
public typealias List = TokamakCore.List
public typealias ScrollView = TokamakCore.ScrollView
public typealias Section = TokamakCore.Section
public typealias Spacer = TokamakCore.Spacer
public typealias Text = TokamakCore.Text
public typealias VStack = TokamakCore.VStack
public typealias ZStack = TokamakCore.ZStack

// MARK: Special Views

public typealias View = TokamakCore.View
public typealias AnyView = TokamakCore.AnyView
public typealias EmptyView = TokamakCore.EmptyView

// MARK: Misc

// Note: This extension is required to support concatenation of `Text`.
extension Text {
  public static func + (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self {
    _concatenating(lhs: lhs, rhs: rhs)
  }
}

```

Weâ€™ve omitted any stateful `Views`, as well as property wrappers used to modify state.

## Building the `Target`

If you recall, we defined a `Target` as:

> the destination for rendered `Views`

In `TokamakStaticHTML`, this would be a tag in an `HTML` file. A tag has several properties,
although we donâ€™t need to worry about all of them. For now, we can consider a tag to have:

- The HTML for the tag itself (outer HTML)
- Child tags (inner HTML)

We can describe our target simply:

```swift
public final class HTMLTarget: Target {
  var html: AnyHTML
  var children: [HTMLTarget] = []

  init<V: View>(_ view: V,
                _ html: AnyHTML) {
    self.html = html
    super.init(view)
  }
}
```

`AnyHTML` type is coming from `TokamakDOM`, which you can declare as a dependency. The target stores
the `View` it hosts, the `HTML` that represents it, and its child elements.

Lastly, we can also provide an HTML string representation of the target:

```swift
extension HTMLTarget {
  var outerHTML: String {
    """
    <\(html.tag)\(html.attributes.isEmpty ? "" : " ")\
    \(html.attributes.map { #"\#($0)="\#($1)""# }.joined(separator: " "))>\
    \(html.innerHTML ?? "")\
    \(children.map(\.outerHTML).joined(separator: "\n"))\
    </\(html.tag)>
    """
  }
}
```

## Building the `Renderer`

Now that we have a `Target`, we can start the `Renderer`:

```swift
public final class StaticHTMLRenderer: Renderer {
  public private(set) var reconciler: StackReconciler<StaticHTMLRenderer>?
  var rootTarget: HTMLTarget

  public var html: String {
    """
    <html>
    \(rootTarget.outerHTML)
    </html>
    """
  }
}
```

We start by declaring the `StackReconciler`. It will handle the app, while our `Renderer` can focus
on mounting and un-mounting `Views`.

```swift
...
public init<V: View>(_ view: V) {
  rootTarget = HTMLTarget(view, HTMLBody())
  reconciler = StackReconciler(
    view: view,
    target: rootTarget,
    renderer: self,
    environment: EnvironmentValues()
  ) { closure in
    fatalError("Stateful apps cannot be created with TokamakStaticHTML")
  }
}
```

Next we declare an initializer that takes a `View` and builds a reconciler. The reconciler takes the
`View`, our root `Target` (in this case, `HTMLBody`), the renderer (`self`), and any default
`EnvironmentValues` we may need to setup. The closure at the end is the scheduler. It tells the
reconciler when it can update. In this case, we wonâ€™t need to update, so we can crash.

`HTMLBody` is declared like so:

```swift
struct HTMLBody: AnyHTML {
  let tag: String = "body"
  let innerHTML: String? = nil
  let attributes: [String : String] = [:]
  let listeners: [String : Listener] = [:]
}
```

### Mounting

Now that we have a reconciler, we need to be able to mount the `HTMLTargets` it asks for.

```swift
public func mountTarget(to parent: HTMLTarget, with host: MountedHost) -> HTMLTarget? {
  // 1.
  guard let html = mapAnyView(
    host.view,
    transform: { (html: AnyHTML) in html }
  ) else {
    // 2.
    if mapAnyView(host.view, transform: { (view: ParentView) in view }) != nil {
      return parent
    }

    return nil
  }

  // 3.
  let node = HTMLTarget(host.view, html)
  parent.children.append(node)
  return node
}}
```

1. We use the `mapAnyView` function to convert the `AnyView` passed in to `AnyHTML`, which can be
   used with our `HTMLTarget`.
2. `ParentView` is a special type of `View` in Tokamak. It indicates that the view has no
   representation itself, and is purely a container for children (e.g. `ForEach` or `Group`).
3. We create a new `HTMLTarget` for the view, assign it as a child of the parent, and return it.

The other two functions required by the `Renderer` protocol can crash, as `TokamakStaticHTML`
doesnâ€™t support state changes:

```swift
public func update(target: HTMLTarget, with host: MountedHost) {
  fatalError("Stateful apps cannot be created with TokamakStaticHTML")
}

public func unmount(
  target: HTMLTarget,
  from parent: HTMLTarget,
  with host: MountedHost,
  completion: @escaping () -> ()
) {
  fatalError("Stateful apps cannot be created with TokamakStaticHTML")
}
```

If you are creating a `Renderer` that supports state changes, hereâ€™s a quick synopsis:

- `func update` - Mutate the `target` to match the `host`.
- `func unmount` - Remove the `target` from the `parent`, and call `completion` once it has been
  removed.

Now that we can mount, letâ€™s give it a try:

```swift
struct ContentView : View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("Hello, world!")
  }
}

let renderer = StaticHTMLRenderer(ContentView())
print(renderer.html)
```

This spits out:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <span style="...">Hello, world!</span>
  </body>
</html>
```

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You successfully wrote a `Renderer`. We canâ€™t wait to see what platforms youâ€™ll
bring Tokamak to.

## Providing platform-specific primitives

Primitive `Views`, such as `Text`, `Button`, `HStack`, etc. have a body type of `Never`. When the
`StackReconciler` goes to render these `Views`, it expects your `Renderer` to provide a body.

This is done via a few additional functions in the `Renderer` protocol.

```swift
public protocol Renderer: AnyObject {
  // ...
  // Functions unrelated to this feature skipped for brevity.

  /** Returns a body of a given pritimive view, or `nil` if `view` is not a primitive view for
   this renderer.
   */
  func primitiveBody(for view: Any) -> AnyView?

  /** Returns `true` if a given view type is a primitive view that should be deferred to this
   renderer.
   */
  func isPrimitiveView(_ type: Any.Type) -> Bool
}
```

This allows to declare a renderer-specific protocol for these views. Let's call it `HTMLPrimitive`:

```swift
public protocol HTMLPrimitive {
  var renderedBody: AnyView { get }
}
```

Then add the implementation using this protocol to your `StaticHTMLRenderer`:

```swift
public final class StaticHTMLRenderer: Renderer {
  // ...
  // Rest of the functions skipped for brevity.

  public func isPrimitiveView(_ type: Any.Type) -> Bool {
    type is HTMLPrimitive.Type
  }

  public func primitiveBody(for view: Any) -> AnyView? {
    (view as? HTMLPrimitive)?.renderedBody
  }
}
```

In a conformance to `HTMLPrimitive` we can provide a `View` that our
`Renderer` understands. For instance, `TokamakDOM` (and `TokamakStaticHTML` by extension) use the
`HTML` view. Letâ€™s look at a simpler version of this view:

```swift
protocol AnyHTML {
  let tag: String
  let attributes: [String:String]
  let innerHTML: String
}

struct HTML: View, AnyHTML {
  let tag: String
  let attributes: [String:String]
  let innerHTML: String
  var body: Never {
    neverBody("HTML")
  }
}
```

Here we define an `HTML` view to have a body type of `Never`, like other primitive `Views`. It also
conforms to `AnyHTML`, which allows our `Renderer` to access the attributes of the `HTML` without
worrying about the `associatedtypes` involved with `View`.

### `HTMLPrimitive`

Now we can use `HTML` to override the body of the primitive `Views` provided by `TokamakCore`:

```swift
extension Text: HTMLPrimitive {
  var renderedBody: AnyView {
    AnyView(HTML("span", [:], _TextProxy(self).rawText))
  }
}
```

If you recall, our `Renderer` mapped the `AnyView` received from the reconciler to `AnyHTML`:

```swift
// 1.
guard let html = mapAnyView(
  host.view,
  transform: { (html: AnyHTML) in html }
) else { ... }
```

Then we were able to access the properties of the HTML.

### Proxies

Proxies allow access to internal properties of views implemented by `TokamakCore`. For instance, to
access the storage of the `Text` view, we were required to use a `_TextProxy`.

Proxies contain all of the properties of the primitive necessary to build your platform-specific
implementation.
