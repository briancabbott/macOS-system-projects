Bridging to WinRT (Windows Runtime) to [Swift](https://www.swift.org).

## Example

Basic synchronous calls to the Windows Runtime:
```swift
import WinRT

do {
  RoInitialize()

  // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.System.Profile.SystemIdentification?view=winrt-17763
  let buffer =
      Windows.System.Profile.SystemIdentification.GetSystemIdForPublisher()

  // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer?view=winrt-17763
  print(Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.EncodeToHexString(buffer.Id))
} catch let error {
  print(error)
}
```

Basic asynchronous call into the Windows Runtime:
```swift
import WinRT

@main
struct Asynchronous {
  public static func main() async throws {
    try RoInitialize()
    let controller =
        try Windows.System.DispatcherQueueController.CreateOnDedicatedThread()
    try await controller.ShutdownQueue()
  }
}
```

## Build Requirements

- Latest Swift **Development** Snapshot (2021-03-21 or later)<sup>[1](#snapshot-requirements)</sup>
- Windows 10
- Windows SDK 10.0.107763 or newer

<sup><a name="snapshot-requirements">1</a></sup> Stable releases are not currently supported as they are built from release branches, and this project requires the latest development snapshot from the `main` branch.<br/>

## Building

This project requires the latest Swift snapshot (March 21, 2021 or later).  You can use the snapshot binaries from
[swift.org](https://swift.org/download#snapshots) or download the nightly build
from [Azure](https://dev.azure.com/compnerd/swift-build/_build?definitionId=7).

## Debugging

Debugging for Swift/WinRT is complicated by the fact that the code is highly
intertwined with the system code, with the call stack excessively calling
between C++, C, and Swift portions.  Most issues tend to occur between the Swift
and the C/C++ aspects of the system.  This is most effectively debugged using
WinDBG.  The following will enable CodeView debug information generation for The
Swift code, enabling a better experience with WinDBG:

```cmd
swift build -Xswiftc -g -Xswiftc -debug-info-format=codeview -Xlinker -debug
```

For debugging with lldb, you can use the following command line to ensure that
the DWARF data is emitted properly:

```cmd
swift build -Xlinker -debug:dwarf
```

## About Swift/WinRT

This project is highly experimental.  It is meant to be a playground for
experimenting with both how COM interfaces are exposed as well as the Win/RT
interfaces.  It is modelled from the learnings from
[Swift/COM](https://github.com/compnerd/swift-com).

The files are split into the name of the type that they bridge, but provide only the barest amount of
sugar: mapping the `HRESULT` return value to a `Swift.Error` through the
`WinRT.Error` type.  Additionally, for the cases where it makes sense,
additional sugar is added in a separate file, which appends the `+Swift` suffix.

The long term goals are to generate the unsuffixed files, either through code
generation or through improvements to the Swift compiler's "ClangImporter".
Maturing C++ support should also provide an easier way to bridge the types
through without going through the C ABI layer.
