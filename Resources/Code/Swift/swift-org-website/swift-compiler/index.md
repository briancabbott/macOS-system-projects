The [main Swift repository][swift-repo] contains the source code for
the Swift compiler and standard library, as well as related components
such as SourceKit (for IDE integration), the Swift regression test
suite, and implementation-level documentation.

The [Swift driver repository][swift-driver-repo] contains a new
implementation of the Swift compiler's "driver", which aims to be a
more extensible, maintainable, and robust drop-in replacement for the
existing compiler driver.
