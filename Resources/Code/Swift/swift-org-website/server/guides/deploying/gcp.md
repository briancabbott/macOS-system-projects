title: Deploying to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
---

This guide describes how to build and run your Swift Server on serverless
architecture with [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build) and
[Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). We'll use
[Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/quickstart)
to store the Docker images.

## Google Cloud Platform Setup

You can read about
[Getting Started with GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/getting-started/) in
more detail. In order to run Swift Server applications, we need to:

- enable [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) (requires a credit
  card). Note that when creating a new account, GCP provides you with $300 of
  free credit to use in the first 90 days. You can follow this guide for free
  for a new account. Everything in this guide should fall into the "Free Tier"
  category at GCP (120 build minutes per day, 2 million Cloud Run requests per
  month
  [Free Tier Usage Limits](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier-usage-limits))
- enable the
  [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudbuild.googleapis.com/overview)
- enable the
  [Cloud Run Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/run.googleapis.com/overview)
- enable the
  [Artifact Registry API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/artifactregistry.googleapis.com/overview)
- [create a Repository in the Artifact Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/create-repo)
  (Format: Docker, Region: your choice)

## Project Requirements

Please verify that your server listens on `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1` and it's
recommended to use the environment variable `$PORT` instead of a hard-coded
value. For the workflow to pass, two files are essential, both need to be in the
project root:

1. Dockerfile
2. cloudbuild.yaml

### `Dockerfile`

You should test your Dockerfile with `docker build . -t test` and
`docker run -p 8080:8080 test` and make sure it builds and runs locally.

The _Dockerfile_ is the same as in the [packaging guide]({{site.url}}/server/guides/packaging.html#docker).
Replace `<executable-name>` with your `executableTarget` (ie. "Server"):

```Dockerfile
#------- build -------
FROM swift:centos as builder

# set up the workspace
RUN mkdir /workspace
WORKDIR /workspace

# copy the source to the docker image
COPY . /workspace

RUN swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib

#------- package -------
FROM centos:8
# copy executable
COPY --from=builder /workspace/.build/release/<executable-name> /

# set the entry point (application name)
CMD ["<executable-name>"]
```

### `cloudbuild.yaml`

The `cloudbuild.yaml` files contains a set of steps to build the server image
directly in the cloud and deploy a new Cloud Run instance after the successful
build. `${_VAR}` are
["substitution variables"](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values)
that are available during build time and can be passed on into the runtime
environment in the "deploy" phase. We will set the variables later when we
configure the [Build Trigger](#deployment) (Step 5).

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        docker pull ${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:latest || exit 0
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - build
      - -t
      - ${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:$SHORT_SHA
      - -t
      - ${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:latest
      - .
      - --cache-from
      - ${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:latest
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      [
        'push',
        '${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:$SHORT_SHA'
      ]
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    args:
      - run
      - deploy
      - swift-service
      - --image=${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:$SHORT_SHA
      - --port=8080
      - --region=${_REGION}
      - --memory=512Mi
      - --platform=managed
      - --allow-unauthenticated
      - --min-instances=0
      - --max-instances=5
images:
  - '${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:$SHORT_SHA'
  - '${_REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${_REPOSITORY_NAME}/${_SERVICE_NAME}:latest'
timeout: 1800s
```

### The steps in detail

1. Pull the latest image from the Artifact Registry to retrieve cached layers
2. Build the image with `$SHORT_SHA` and `latest` tag
3. Push the image to the Artifact Registry
4. Deploy the image to Cloud Run

`images` specifies the build images to store in the registry. The default
`timeout` is 10 minutes, so we'll need to increase it for Swift builds. We use
`8080` as the default port here, though it's recommended to remove this line and
have the server listen on `$PORT`.

## Deployment

![cloud build trigger settings and how to connect a code repository]({{site.url}}/assets/images/server-guides/gcp-connect-repo.png)

Push all files to a remote repository. Cloud Build currently supports, GitHub,
Bitbucket and GitLab. now) and head to
[Cloud Build Triggers](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers)
and click "Create Trigger":

1. Add a name and description
2. Event: "Push to a branch" is active
3. Source: "Connect New Repository" and authorize with your code provider, and
   add the repository where your Swift server code is hosted. Note that you need
   to configure
   [GitHub](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/build-repos-from-github),
   [GitLab](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/build-repos-from-gitlab)
   or
   [Bitbucket](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/build-repos-from-bitbucket-cloud)
   to allow GCP access first.
4. Configuration: "Cloud Build configuration file" / Location: Repository
5. Advanced:
   [Substitution variables](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values):
   You need to set the variables for region, repository name and service name
   here. You can pick a
   [region of your choice](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/) (ie.
   `us-central1`). All custom variables must start with an underscore
   (`_REGION`). `_REPOSITORY_NAME` and `_SERVICE_NAME` are up to you. If you use
   environment variables for example to connect to a database or 3rd party
   services, you can set the values here too.
6. "Create"

As a last step before deploying the new service, go to the
[Cloud Build Settings](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/settings)
and make sure "Cloud Run" is enabled. This gives Cloud Build the necessary IAM
permissions to deploy Cloud Run services.

![cloud build settings]({{site.url}}/assets/images/server-guides/gcp-cloud-build-settings.png)

In the Trigger overview page, you should see your new "swift-service" trigger.
Click on "RUN" on the right to start the trigger manually from the `main`
branch. With a simple Hummingbird project the build takes about 7-8 minutes.
Vapor takes about 25 minutes on the standard/small build machines, which are
fairly slow. "Jordane" from the Vapor Discord community
[recommends using `machineType: E2_HIGHCPU_8`](https://discord.com/channels/431917998102675485/447893851374616576/915819735738888222)
in the `cloudbuild.yaml` to speed up deployments:

```yaml
options:
  machineType: 'E2_HIGHCPU_8'
```

After a successful build you should see the service URL in the build logs:

![successful build and deployment to cloud run]({{site.url}}/assets/images/server-guides/gcp-cloud-build.png)

You can head over to Cloud Run and see your service running there:

![cloud run overview]({{site.url}}/assets/images/server-guides/gcp-cloud-run.png)

The trigger will deploy every new commit on `main`. You can also enable Pull
Request triggers for feature-driven workflows. Cloud Build also allows
blue/green builds, auto-scaling and much more.

You can now connect your custom domain to the new service and go live.

## Cleanup

- delete the Cloud Run service
- delete the Cloud Build trigger
- delete the Artifact Registry repository
