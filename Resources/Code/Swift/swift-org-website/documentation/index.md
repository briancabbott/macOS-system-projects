## Swift Language

### The Swift Programming Language Book
_The Swift Programming Language_ is the authoritative reference for Swift,
offering a guided tour, a comprehensive guide, and a formal reference of the language.

## Standard Library
The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs. Documentation for the standard library is presently hosted on the Apple Developer website.

## Packages
There are a number of packages that are part of the core Swift project. Below is a list of packages that currently offer hosted documentation.

### Swift-DocC
DocC is a documentation compiler that makes it easy for you to produce documentation for your Swift frameworks and packages. The compiler builds your documentation by combining the comments you write in source with extension files, articles, and tutorials that live alongside your package's source code. This documentation is for using the DocC tool to generate documentation for your project.

## API Design Guidelines
Delivering a clear, consistent developer experience when writing Swift code is largely defined by the names and idioms that appear in APIs. These design guidelines explain how to make sure that your code feels like a part of the larger Swift ecosystem.

## Tools

### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution and use of "packages" of Swift code. It's integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies into target products.
