Now that you've been introduced to the Swift REPL, build system, and debugger,
here are a few suggestions for what to do next:

- Check out the [Package Manager project page](/package-manager)
  for a deep dive into the Swift build system and package manager.
- Read [Contributing to Swift](/contributing)
  to learn about the different ways you can participate in the Swift community.
- Go to [developer.apple.com/swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/)
  for additional Swift resources, including videos, sample code, and playgrounds.
