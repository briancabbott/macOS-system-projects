## LLVM and Swift

Swift is built on the [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure][LLVM]. Swift uses the LLVM Core for code generation and optimization (among other things), [Clang][Clang] for interoperability with C and Objective-C, and [LLDB][LLDB] for debugging and the REPL.

Apple maintains a fork of the [LLVM
Core](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) source repository on
GitHub as [llvm-project][llvm-project], respectively. 
This repository track upstreams LLVM development and contains
additional changes for Swift. The upstream LLVM repository
are merged into the Swift-specific repository frequently. Every
attempt is made to minimize the differences between upstream LLVM and
the Apple fork to only those changes specifically required for Swift.

### Where Do LLVM Changes Go?

Swift follows a policy of making a change in the most upstream
repository that is feasible. Contributions to Swift that involve
Apple's version of LLVM Project should go directly into the
upstream LLVM repository unless they are specific to Swift. For
example, an improvement to LLDB's data formatters for a Swift type
belongs in the Apple LLVM Project repository, whereas a bug fix to an LLVM
optimizer---even if it's only been observed when operating on
Swift-generated LLVM IR---belongs in upstream LLVM.

Commits to an upstream LLVM repository are automatically merged
into the appropriate upstream branches in the corresponding Swift
repository (`next` in the [llvm-project][llvm-project].

### Swift and LLVM Developer Policies
Contributions to Swift's LLVM or Clang clones are governed by the [LLVM
Developer Policy](http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html) and
should follow the appropriate
[licensing](http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#copyright-license-and-patents)
and [coding standards](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html).
Issues with LLVM code are tracked using the [LLVM bug database][llvm-bugs].
For LLDB, changes to files with llvm.org comment headers must go to the
[upstream LLDB at llvm.org](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/lldb)
and abide by the [LLVM Developer Policy](http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html)
and [LLDB coding conventions](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html).
Contributions to the Swift-specific parts of LLDB (that is, those with a Swift.org
comment header) use the [Swift license](/community/#license) but still follow
the LLDB coding conventions.
