## Participating in the Swift Evolution Process

Anyone with a good idea can help shape the future features and direction of the language.
To reach the best possible solution to a problem,
we discuss and iterate on ideas in a
[public forum](/community/#swift-evolution).
Once a proposal is refined and approved,
it becomes a release goal,
and is tracked as a feature of an upcoming version of Swift.

To support this process,
the [Swift Evolution repository][swift-evolution-repo]
collects the goals for the upcoming major and minor releases
(as defined by the [core team](/community/#core-team))
as well as proposals for changes to Swift.
The [Swift evolution process][swift-evolution-process] document details how ideas are
proposed, discussed, reviewed, and eventually accepted into upcoming releases.

See the [Swift evolution review schedule][swift-evolution-reviews]
for current and upcoming proposal reviews.
