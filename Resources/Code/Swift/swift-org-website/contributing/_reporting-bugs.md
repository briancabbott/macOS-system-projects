## Reporting Bugs

Reporting bugs is a great way for anyone to help improve Swift. The open source Swift project uses GitHub Issues for tracking bugs.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
If a bug can be reproduced only within an Xcode project or a playground,
or if the bug is associated with an Apple NDA,
please file a report to Apple's [bug reporter][apple-bugtracker] instead.
</div>

When filing a new Swift bug, please include the following:

- **A concise description of the problem.**
  If the issue is a crash, include a stack trace. Otherwise, describe the behavior you were expecting to see, along with the behavior you actually observed.

- **A reproducible test case.**
  If the test case is small (for example, less than 20 lines of code) paste it directly into the issue's description field. Otherwise, upload it as an attachment to the Jira issue.

- **A description of the environment that reproduces the problem.**
  Include the Swift build number, as well as information about your target OS and platform.

Because Swift is under very active development, we receive a lot of bug reports. Before filing a new issue, take a moment to browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues) to make sure you're not filing a duplicate.
