## Adding External Library Dependencies

There may be times where it is appropriate for one of the Swift projects (compiler, Core Libraries, etc.) to make use of libraries that provide functionality on a given platform.  Adding library dependencies impacts the portability of Swift projects, and may involve legal questions as well.

As a rule, all new library dependencies must be **explicitly approved** by the [Project lead](/community/#community-structure).
