Everyone is welcome to contribute to Swift.
Contributing doesn't just mean submitting pull requests---there
are many different ways for you to get involved,
including answering questions on the forums,
reporting or triaging bugs, and participating in the Swift evolution process.

No matter how you want to get involved,
we ask that you first learn what's expected
of anyone who participates in the project
by reading the [Community Overview](/community).
If you're contributing code, you should also know how to build and run
Swift from the repository,
as described in [Source Code](/source-code).
