# Memory Safety

By default, Swift prevents unsafe behavior from happening in your code.
For example,
Swift ensures that variables are initialized before they're used,
memory isn't accessed after it's been deallocated,
and array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.

Swift also makes sure that multiple accesses
to the same area of memory don't conflict,
by requiring code that modifies a location in memory
to have exclusive access to that memory.
Because Swift manages memory automatically,
most of the time you don't have to think about accessing memory at all.
However,
it's important to understand where potential conflicts can occur,
so you can avoid writing code that has conflicting access to memory.
If your code does contain conflicts,
you'll get a compile-time or runtime error.

## Understanding Conflicting Access to Memory

Access to memory happens in your code
when you do things like set the value of a variable
or pass an argument to a function.
For example,
the following code contains both a read access and a write access:

```swift
// A write access to the memory where one is stored.
var one = 1

// A read access from the memory where one is stored.
print("We're number \(one)!")
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-read-write`
  
  ```swifttest
  // A write access to the memory where one is stored.
  -> var one = 1
  ---
  // A read access from the memory where one is stored.
  -> print("We're number \(one)!")
  << We're number 1!
  ```
}

@Comment {
  Might be worth a different example,
  or else I'm going to keep getting "We are Number One" stuck in my head.
}

A conflicting access to memory can occur
when different parts of your code are trying
to access the same location in memory at the same time.
Multiple accesses to a location in memory at the same time
can produce unpredictable or inconsistent behavior.
In Swift, there are ways to modify a value
that span several lines of code,
making it possible to attempt to access a value
in the middle of its own modification.

You can see a similar problem
by thinking about how you update a budget
that's written on a piece of paper.
Updating the budget is a two-step process:
First you add the items' names and prices,
and then you change the total amount
to reflect the items currently on the list.
Before and after the update,
you can read any information from the budget
and get a correct answer,
as shown in the figure below.

![](memory_shopping)


While you're adding items to the budget,
it's in a temporary, invalid state
because the total amount hasn't been updated
to reflect the newly added items.
Reading the total amount
during the process of adding an item
gives you incorrect information.

This example also demonstrates
a challenge you may encounter
when fixing conflicting access to memory:
There are sometimes multiple ways to fix the conflict
that produce different answers,
and it's not always obvious which answer is correct.
In this example,
depending on whether you wanted the original total amount
or the updated total amount,
either $5 or $320 could be the correct answer.
Before you can fix the conflicting access,
you have to determine what it was intended to do.

### Characteristics of Memory Access

There are three characteristics of memory access
to consider in the context of conflicting access:
whether the access is a read or a write,
the duration of the access,
and the location in memory being accessed.
Specifically,
a conflict occurs if you have two accesses
that meet all of the following conditions:

- At least one is a write access or a nonatomic access.
- They access the same location in memory.
- Their durations overlap.

The difference between a read and write access
is usually obvious:
a write access changes the location in memory,
but a read access doesn't.
The location in memory
refers to what is being accessed ---
for example, a variable, constant, or property.
The duration of a memory access
is either instantaneous or long-term.

An operation is *atomic*
if it uses only C atomic operations;
otherwise it's nonatomic.
For a list of those functions, see the `stdatomic(3)` man page.

@Comment {
  Using these functions from Swift requires some shimming -- for example:
  https://github.com/apple/swift-se-0282-experimental/tree/master/Sources/_AtomicsShims
}

An access is *instantaneous*
if it's not possible for other code to run
after that access starts but before it ends.
By their nature, two instantaneous accesses can't happen at the same time.
Most memory access is instantaneous.
For example,
all the read and write accesses in the code listing below are instantaneous:

```swift
func oneMore(than number: Int) -> Int {
    return number + 1
}

var myNumber = 1
myNumber = oneMore(than: myNumber)
print(myNumber)
// Prints "2"
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-instantaneous`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> func oneMore(than number: Int) -> Int {
         return number + 1
     }
  ---
  -> var myNumber = 1
  -> myNumber = oneMore(than: myNumber)
  -> print(myNumber)
  <- 2
  ```
}

However,
there are several ways to access memory,
called *long-term* accesses,
that span the execution of other code.
The difference between instantaneous access and long-term access
is that itâ€™s possible for other code to run
after a long-term access starts but before it ends,
which is called *overlap*.
A long-term access can overlap
with other long-term accesses and instantaneous accesses.

Overlapping accesses appear primarily in code that uses
in-out parameters in functions and methods
or mutating methods of a structure.
The specific kinds of Swift code that use long-term accesses
are discussed in the sections below.

## Conflicting Access to In-Out Parameters

A function has long-term write access
to all of its in-out parameters.
The write access for an in-out parameter starts
after all of the non-in-out parameters have been evaluated
and lasts for the entire duration of that function call.
If there are multiple in-out parameters,
the write accesses start in the same order as the parameters appear.

One consequence of this long-term write access
is that you can't access the original
variable that was passed as in-out,
even if scoping rules and access control would otherwise permit it ---
any access to the original creates a conflict.
For example:

```swift
var stepSize = 1

func increment(_ number: inout Int) {
    number += stepSize
}

increment(&stepSize)
// Error: conflicting accesses to stepSize
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-increment`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> var stepSize = 1
  ---
  -> func increment(_ number: inout Int) {
         number += stepSize
     }
  ---
  -> increment(&stepSize)
  // Error: conflicting accesses to stepSize
  xx Simultaneous accesses to 0x10e8667d8, but modification requires exclusive access.
  xx Previous access (a modification) started at  (0x10e86b032).
  xx Current access (a read) started at:
  ```
}

In the code above,
`stepSize` is a global variable,
and it's normally accessible from within `increment(_:)`.
However,
the read access to `stepSize` overlaps with
the write access to `number`.
As shown in the figure below,
both `number` and `stepSize` refer to the same location in memory.
The read and write accesses
refer to the same memory and they overlap,
producing a conflict.

![](memory_increment)


One way to solve this conflict
is to make an explicit copy of `stepSize`:

```swift
// Make an explicit copy.
var copyOfStepSize = stepSize
increment(&copyOfStepSize)

// Update the original.
stepSize = copyOfStepSize
// stepSize is now 2
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-increment-copy`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> var stepSize = 1
  >> func increment(_ number: inout Int) {
  >>     number += stepSize
  >> }
  // Make an explicit copy.
  -> var copyOfStepSize = stepSize
  -> increment(&copyOfStepSize)
  ---
  // Update the original.
  -> stepSize = copyOfStepSize
  /> stepSize is now \(stepSize)
  </ stepSize is now 2
  ```
}

When you make a copy of `stepSize` before calling `increment(_:)`,
it's clear that the value of `copyOfStepSize` is incremented
by the current step size.
The read access ends before the write access starts,
so there isn't a conflict.

Another consequence of long-term write access
to in-out parameters is that
passing a single variable
as the argument for multiple in-out parameters
of the same function
produces a conflict.
For example:

```swift
func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
    let sum = x + y
    x = sum / 2
    y = sum - x
}
var playerOneScore = 42
var playerTwoScore = 30
balance(&playerOneScore, &playerTwoScore)  // OK
balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
// Error: conflicting accesses to playerOneScore
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-balance`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
         let sum = x + y
         x = sum / 2
         y = sum - x
     }
  -> var playerOneScore = 42
  -> var playerTwoScore = 30
  -> balance(&playerOneScore, &playerTwoScore)  // OK
  -> balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
  // Error: conflicting accesses to playerOneScore
  !$ error: inout arguments are not allowed to alias each other
  !! balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
  !!                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  !$ note: previous aliasing argument
  !! balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
  !!         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  !$ error: overlapping accesses to 'playerOneScore', but modification requires exclusive access; consider copying to a local variable
  !! balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
  !!                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  !$ note: conflicting access is here
  !! balance(&playerOneScore, &playerOneScore)
  !!         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ```
}

The `balance(_:_:)` function above
modifies its two parameters
to divide the total value evenly between them.
Calling it with `playerOneScore` and `playerTwoScore` as arguments
doesn't produce a conflict ---
there are two write accesses that overlap in time,
but they access different locations in memory.
In contrast,
passing `playerOneScore` as the value for both parameters
produces a conflict
because it tries to perform two write accesses
to the same location in memory at the same time.

> Note: Because operators are functions,
> they can also have long-term accesses to their in-out parameters.
> For example, if `balance(_:_:)` was an operator function named `<^>`,

## Conflicting Access to self in Methods

@Comment {
  This (probably?) applies to all value types,
  but structures are the only place you can observe it.
  Enumerations can have mutating methods
  but you can't mutate their associated values in place,
  and tuples can't have methods.
}

@Comment {
  Methods behave like self is passed to the method as inout
  because, under the hood, that's exactly what happens.
}

A mutating method on a structure has write access to `self`
for the duration of the method call.
For example, consider a game where each player
has a health amount, which decreases when taking damage,
and an energy amount, which decreases when using special abilities.

```swift
struct Player {
    var name: String
    var health: Int
    var energy: Int

    static let maxHealth = 10
    mutating func restoreHealth() {
        health = Player.maxHealth
    }
}
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-player-share-with-self`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
  >>     let sum = x + y
  >>     x = sum / 2
  >>     y = sum - x
  >> }
  -> struct Player {
         var name: String
         var health: Int
         var energy: Int
  
         static let maxHealth = 10
         mutating func restoreHealth() {
             health = Player.maxHealth
         }
     }
  ```
}

In the `restoreHealth()` method above,
a write access to `self` starts at the beginning of the method
and lasts until the method returns.
In this case, there's no other code
inside `restoreHealth()`
that could have an overlapping access to the properties of a `Player` instance.
The `shareHealth(with:)` method below
takes another `Player` instance as an in-out parameter,
creating the possibility of overlapping accesses.

```swift
extension Player {
    mutating func shareHealth(with teammate: inout Player) {
        balance(&teammate.health, &health)
    }
}

var oscar = Player(name: "Oscar", health: 10, energy: 10)
var maria = Player(name: "Maria", health: 5, energy: 10)
oscar.shareHealth(with: &maria)  // OK
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-player-share-with-self`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> extension Player {
         mutating func shareHealth(with teammate: inout Player) {
             balance(&teammate.health, &health)
         }
     }
  ---
  -> var oscar = Player(name: "Oscar", health: 10, energy: 10)
  -> var maria = Player(name: "Maria", health: 5, energy: 10)
  -> oscar.shareHealth(with: &maria)  // OK
  ```
}

In the example above,
calling the `shareHealth(with:)` method
for Oscar's player to share health with Maria's player
doesn't cause a conflict.
There's a write access to `oscar` during the method call
because `oscar` is the value of `self` in a mutating method,
and there's a write access to `maria`
for the same duration
because `maria` was passed as an in-out parameter.
As shown in the figure below,
they access different locations in memory.
Even though the two write accesses overlap in time,
they don't conflict.

![](memory_share_health_maria)


However,
if you pass `oscar` as the argument to `shareHealth(with:)`,
there's a conflict:

```swift
oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
// Error: conflicting accesses to oscar
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-player-share-with-self`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
  // Error: conflicting accesses to oscar
  !$ error: inout arguments are not allowed to alias each other
  !! oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
  !!                         ^~~~~~
  !$ note: previous aliasing argument
  !! oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
  !! ^~~~~
  !$ error: overlapping accesses to 'oscar', but modification requires exclusive access; consider copying to a local variable
  !! oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
  !!                          ^~~~~
  !$ note: conflicting access is here
  !! oscar.shareHealth(with: &oscar)
  !! ^~~~~~
  ```
}

The mutating method needs write access to `self`
for the duration of the method,
and the in-out parameter needs write access to `teammate`
for the same duration.
Within the method,
both `self` and `teammate` refer to
the same location in memory ---
as shown in the figure below.
The two write accesses
refer to the same memory and they overlap,
producing a conflict.

![](memory_share_health_oscar)


## Conflicting Access to Properties

Types like structures, tuples, and enumerations
are made up of individual constituent values,
such as the properties of a structure or the elements of a tuple.
Because these are value types, mutating any piece of the value
mutates the whole value,
meaning read or write access to one of the properties
requires read or write access to the whole value.
For example,
overlapping write accesses to the elements of a tuple
produces a conflict:

```swift
var playerInformation = (health: 10, energy: 20)
balance(&playerInformation.health, &playerInformation.energy)
// Error: conflicting access to properties of playerInformation
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-tuple`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
  >>     let sum = x + y
  >>     x = sum / 2
  >>     y = sum - x
  >> }
  -> var playerInformation = (health: 10, energy: 20)
  -> balance(&playerInformation.health, &playerInformation.energy)
  // Error: conflicting access to properties of playerInformation
  xx Simultaneous accesses to 0x10794d848, but modification requires exclusive access.
  xx Previous access (a modification) started at  (0x107952037).
  xx Current access (a modification) started at:
  ```
}

In the example above,
calling `balance(_:_:)` on the elements of a tuple
produces a conflict
because there are overlapping write accesses to `playerInformation`.
Both `playerInformation.health` and `playerInformation.energy`
are passed as in-out parameters,
which means `balance(_:_:)` needs write access to them
for the duration of the function call.
In both cases, a write access to the tuple element
requires a write access to the entire tuple.
This means there are two write accesses to `playerInformation`
with durations that overlap,
causing a conflict.

The code below shows that the same error appears
for overlapping write accesses
to the properties of a structure
that's stored in a global variable.

```swift
var holly = Player(name: "Holly", health: 10, energy: 10)
balance(&holly.health, &holly.energy)  // Error
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-share-health-global`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> struct Player {
  >>     var name: String
  >>     var health: Int
  >>     var energy: Int
  >> }
  >> func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
  >>     let sum = x + y
  >>     x = sum / 2
  >>     y = sum - x
  >> }
  -> var holly = Player(name: "Holly", health: 10, energy: 10)
  -> balance(&holly.health, &holly.energy)  // Error
  xx Simultaneous accesses to 0x10794d848, but modification requires exclusive access.
  xx Previous access (a modification) started at  (0x107952037).
  xx Current access (a modification) started at:
  ```
}

In practice,
most access to the properties of a structure
can overlap safely.
For example,
if the variable `holly` in the example above
is changed to a local variable instead of a global variable,
the compiler can prove that overlapping access
to stored properties of the structure is safe:

```swift
func someFunction() {
    var oscar = Player(name: "Oscar", health: 10, energy: 10)
    balance(&oscar.health, &oscar.energy)  // OK
}
```


@Comment {
  - test: `memory-share-health-local`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> struct Player {
  >>     var name: String
  >>     var health: Int
  >>     var energy: Int
  >> }
  >> func balance(_ x: inout Int, _ y: inout Int) {
  >>     let sum = x + y
  >>     x = sum / 2
  >>     y = sum - x
  >> }
  -> func someFunction() {
         var oscar = Player(name: "Oscar", health: 10, energy: 10)
         balance(&oscar.health, &oscar.energy)  // OK
     }
  >> someFunction()
  ```
}

In the example above,
Oscar's health and energy are passed
as the two in-out parameters to `balance(_:_:)`.
The compiler can prove that memory safety is preserved
because the two stored properties don't interact in any way.

The restriction against
overlapping access to properties of a structure
isn't always necessary to preserve memory safety.
Memory safety is the desired guarantee,
but exclusive access is a stricter requirement than memory safety ---
which means some code preserves memory safety,
even though it violates exclusive access to memory.
Swift allows this memory-safe code if the compiler can prove
that the nonexclusive access to memory is still safe.
Specifically, it can prove
that overlapping access to properties of a structure is safe
if the following conditions apply:

- You're accessing only stored properties of an instance,
  not computed properties or class properties.
- The structure is the value of a local variable,
  not a global variable.
- The structure is either not captured by any closures,
  or it's captured only by nonescaping closures.

If the compiler can't prove the access is safe,
it doesn't allow the access.

@Comment {
  Because there's no syntax
  to mutate an enum's associated value in place,
  we can't show that overlapping mutations
  to two different associated values on the same enum
  would violate exclusivity.
  Otherwise, we'd want an example of that
  in this section too --
  it's the moral equivalent of property access.

@Comment {
  TEXT FOR THE FUTURE
  
  Versions of Swift before Swift 5 ensure memory safety
  by aggressively making a copy of the shared mutable state
  when a conflicting access is possible.
  The copy is no longer shared, preventing the possibility of conflicts.
  However, the copying approach has a negative impact
  on performance and memory usage.
