# Nested Types

Enumerations are often created to support a specific class or structure's functionality.
Similarly, it can be convenient to define utility classes and structures
purely for use within the context of a more complex type.
To accomplish this, Swift enables you to define *nested types*,
whereby you nest supporting enumerations, classes, and structures
within the definition of the type they support.

To nest a type within another type,
write its definition within the outer braces of the type it supports.
Types can be nested to as many levels as are required.

## Nested Types in Action

The example below defines a structure called `BlackjackCard`,
which models a playing card as used in the game of Blackjack.
The `BlackjackCard` structure contains two nested enumeration types
called `Suit` and `Rank`.

In Blackjack, the Ace cards have a value of either one or eleven.
This feature is represented by a structure called `Values`,
which is nested within the `Rank` enumeration:

```swift
struct BlackjackCard {

   // nested Suit enumeration
   enum Suit: Character {
      case spades = "♠", hearts = "♡", diamonds = "♢", clubs = "♣"
   }

   // nested Rank enumeration
   enum Rank: Int {
      case two = 2, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
      case jack, queen, king, ace
      struct Values {
         let first: Int, second: Int?
      }
      var values: Values {
         switch self {
            case .ace:
               return Values(first: 1, second: 11)
            case .jack, .queen, .king:
               return Values(first: 10, second: nil)
            default:
               return Values(first: self.rawValue, second: nil)
         }
      }
   }

   // BlackjackCard properties and methods
   let rank: Rank, suit: Suit
   var description: String {
      var output = "suit is \(suit.rawValue),"
      output += " value is \(rank.values.first)"
      if let second = rank.values.second {
         output += " or \(second)"
      }
      return output
   }
}
```

        // nested Suit enumeration
        enum Suit: Character {
           case spades = "♠", hearts = "♡", diamonds = "♢", clubs = "♣"
        }
  ---
        // nested Rank enumeration
        enum Rank: Int {
           case two = 2, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
           case jack, queen, king, ace
           struct Values {
              let first: Int, second: Int?
           }
           var values: Values {
              switch self {
                 case .ace:
                    return Values(first: 1, second: 11)
                 case .jack, .queen, .king:
                    return Values(first: 10, second: nil)
                 default:
                    return Values(first: self.rawValue, second: nil)
              }
           }
        }
  ---
        // BlackjackCard properties and methods
        let rank: Rank, suit: Suit
        var description: String {
           var output = "suit is \(suit.rawValue),"
           output += " value is \(rank.values.first)"
           if let second = rank.values.second {
              output += " or \(second)"
           }
           return output
        }
     }
  ```
}

The `Suit` enumeration describes the four common playing card suits,
together with a raw `Character` value to represent their symbol.

The `Rank` enumeration describes the thirteen possible playing card ranks,
together with a raw `Int` value to represent their face value.
(This raw `Int` value isn't used for the Jack, Queen, King, and Ace cards.)

As mentioned above, the `Rank` enumeration defines
a further nested structure of its own, called `Values`.
This structure encapsulates the fact that most cards have one value,
but the Ace card has two values.
The `Values` structure defines two properties to represent this:

- `first`, of type `Int`
- `second`, of type `Int?`, or “optional `Int`”

`Rank` also defines a computed property, `values`,
which returns an instance of the `Values` structure.
This computed property considers the rank of the card
and initializes a new `Values` instance with appropriate values based on its rank.
It uses special values for `jack`, `queen`, `king`, and `ace`.
For the numeric cards, it uses the rank's raw `Int` value.

The `BlackjackCard` structure itself has two properties --- `rank` and `suit`.
It also defines a computed property called `description`,
which uses the values stored in `rank` and `suit` to build
a description of the name and value of the card.
The `description` property uses optional binding to check whether there's
a second value to display, and if so,
inserts additional description detail for that second value.

Because `BlackjackCard` is a structure with no custom initializers,
it has an implicit memberwise initializer,
as described in <doc:Initialization#Memberwise-Initializers-for-Structure-Types>.
You can use this initializer to initialize a new constant called `theAceOfSpades`:

```swift
let theAceOfSpades = BlackjackCard(rank: .ace, suit: .spades)
print("theAceOfSpades: \(theAceOfSpades.description)")
// Prints "theAceOfSpades: suit is ♠, value is 1 or 11"
```


@Comment {
  - test: `nestedTypes`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> let theAceOfSpades = BlackjackCard(rank: .ace, suit: .spades)
  -> print("theAceOfSpades: \(theAceOfSpades.description)")
  <- theAceOfSpades: suit is ♠, value is 1 or 11
  ```
}

Even though `Rank` and `Suit` are nested within `BlackjackCard`,
their type can be inferred from context,
and so the initialization of this instance is able to refer to the enumeration cases
by their case names (`.ace` and `.spades`) alone.
In the example above, the `description` property correctly reports that
the Ace of Spades has a value of `1` or `11`.

## Referring to Nested Types

To use a nested type outside of its definition context,
prefix its name with the name of the type it's nested within:

```swift
let heartsSymbol = BlackjackCard.Suit.hearts.rawValue
// heartsSymbol is "♡"
```


@Comment {
  - test: `nestedTypes`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> let heartsSymbol = BlackjackCard.Suit.hearts.rawValue
  /> heartsSymbol is \"\(heartsSymbol)\"
  </ heartsSymbol is "♡"
  ```
}

For the example above,
this enables the names of `Suit`, `Rank`, and `Values` to be kept deliberately short,
because their names are naturally qualified by the context in which they're defined.
