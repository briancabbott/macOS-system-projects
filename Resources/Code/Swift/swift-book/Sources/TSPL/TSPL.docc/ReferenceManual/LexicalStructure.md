# Lexical Structure

The *lexical structure* of Swift describes what sequence of characters
form valid tokens of the language.
These valid tokens form the lowest-level building blocks of the language
and are used to describe the rest of the language in subsequent chapters.
A token consists of an identifier, keyword, punctuation, literal, or operator.

In most cases, tokens are generated from the characters of a Swift source file
by considering the longest possible substring from the input text,
within the constraints of the grammar that are specified below.
This behavior is referred to as *longest match*
or *maximal munch*.

## Whitespace and Comments

Whitespace has two uses: to separate tokens in the source file
and to distinguish between prefix, postfix, and infix operators
(see <doc:LexicalStructure#Operators>),
but is otherwise ignored.
The following characters are considered whitespace:
space (U+0020),
line feed (U+000A),
carriage return (U+000D),
horizontal tab (U+0009),
vertical tab (U+000B),
form feed (U+000C)
and null (U+0000).

@Comment {
  Whitespace characters are listed roughly from
  most salient/common to least,
  not in order of Unicode scalar value.
}

Comments are treated as whitespace by the compiler.
Single line comments begin with `//`
and continue until a line feed (U+000A)  or carriage return (U+000D).
Multiline comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.
Nesting multiline comments is allowed,
but the comment markers must be balanced.

Comments can contain additional formatting and markup,
as described in [Markup Formatting Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html).

```


## Identifiers

*Identifiers* begin with
an uppercase or lowercase letter A through Z,
an underscore (`_`),
a noncombining alphanumeric Unicode character
in the Basic Multilingual Plane,
or a character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane
that isn't in a Private Use Area.
After the first character,
digits and combining Unicode characters are also allowed.

Treat identifiers that begin with an underscore as internal,
even if their declaration has the `public` access-level modifier.
This convention lets framework authors mark part of an API
that clients must not interact with or depend on,
even though some limitation requires the declaration to be public.
In addition,
identifiers that begin with two underscores
are reserved for the Swift compiler and standard library.

To use a reserved word as an identifier,
put a backtick (\`) before and after it.
For example, `class` isn't a valid identifier,
but \``class`\` is valid.
The backticks aren't considered part of the identifier;
\``x`\` and `x` have the same meaning.

Inside a closure with no explicit parameter names,
the parameters are implicitly named `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, and so on.
These names are valid identifiers within the scope of the closure.

The compiler synthesizes identifiers that begin with a dollar sign (`$`)
for properties that have a property wrapper projection.
Your code can interact with these identifiers,
but you can't declare identifiers with that prefix.
For more information, see the <doc:Attributes#propertyWrapper> section
of the <doc:Attributes> chapter.

@Comment {
  The cross reference above includes both the section and chapter because,
  even though "propertyWrapper" is the title of the section,
  the section name isn't title case so it doesn't necessarily look like a title.

## Keywords and Punctuation

The following keywords are reserved and can't be used as identifiers,
unless they're escaped with backticks,
as described above in <doc:LexicalStructure#Identifiers>.
Keywords other than `inout`, `var`, and `let`
can be used as parameter names
in a function declaration or function call
without being escaped with backticks.
When a member has the same name as a keyword,
references to that member don't need to be escaped with backticks,
except when there's ambiguity between referring to the member
and using the keyword ---
for example, `self`, `Type`, and `Protocol`
have special meaning in an explicit member expression,
so they must be escaped with backticks in that context.

## Literals

A *literal* is the source code representation of a value of a type,
such as a number or string.

The following are examples of literals:

```swift
42               // Integer literal
3.14159          // Floating-point literal
"Hello, world!"  // String literal
/Hello, .*/      // Regular expression literal
true             // Boolean literal
```


@Comment {
  - test: `basic-literals`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> let r0 =
  -> 42               // Integer literal
  >> let r1 =
  -> 3.14159          // Floating-point literal
  >> let r2 =
  -> "Hello, world!"  // String literal
  >> let r4 =
  -> /Hello, .*/      // Regular expression literal
  >> let r3 =
  -> true             // Boolean literal
  >> for x in [r0, r1, r2, r3] as [Any] { print(type(of: x)) }
  << Int
  << Double
  << String
  << Bool
  ```
}

@Comment {
  Refactor the above if possible to avoid using bare expressions.
  Tracking bug is <rdar://problem/35301593>
}

A literal doesn't have a type on its own.
Instead, a literal is parsed as having infinite precision and Swift's type inference
attempts to infer a type for the literal. For example,
in the declaration `let x: Int8 = 42`,
Swift uses the explicit type annotation (`: Int8`) to infer
that the type of the integer literal `42` is `Int8`.
If there isn't suitable type information available,
Swift infers that the literal's type is one of the default literal types
defined in the Swift standard library
and listed in the table below.
When specifying the type annotation for a literal value,
the annotation's type must be a type that can be instantiated from that literal value.
That is, the type must conform to the Swift standard library protocols
listed in the table below.


| Literal | Default type | Protocol |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Integer | `Int` | `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` |
| Floating-point | `Double` | `ExpressibleByFloatLiteral` |
| String | `String` | `ExpressibleByStringLiteral`, `ExpressibleByUnicodeScalarLiteral` for string literals that contain only a single Unicode scalar, `ExpressibleByExtendedGraphemeClusterLiteral` for string literals that contain only a single extended grapheme cluster |
| Regular expression | `Regex` | None |
| Boolean | `Bool` | `ExpressibleByBooleanLiteral` |

For example, in the declaration `let str = "Hello, world"`,
the default inferred type of the string
literal `"Hello, world"` is `String`.
Also, `Int8` conforms to the `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` protocol,
and therefore it can be used in the type annotation for the integer literal `42`
in the declaration `let x: Int8 = 42`.

@Comment {
  The list of ExpressibleBy... protocols above also appears in Declarations_EnumerationsWithRawCaseValues.
  ExpressibleByNilLiteral is left out of the list because conformance to it isn't recommended.
  There is no protocol for regex literal in the list because the stdlib intentionally omits that.
}

boolean-literal --> ``true`` | ``false``
nil-literal --> ``nil``
```


### Integer Literals

*Integer literals* represent integer values of unspecified precision.
By default, integer literals are expressed in decimal;
you can specify an alternate base using a prefix.
Binary literals begin with `0b`,
octal literals begin with `0o`,
and hexadecimal literals begin with `0x`.

Decimal literals contain the digits `0` through `9`.
Binary literals contain `0` and `1`,
octal literals contain `0` through `7`,
and hexadecimal literals contain `0` through `9`
as well as `A` through `F` in upper- or lowercase.

Negative integers literals are expressed by prepending a minus sign (`-`)
to an integer literal, as in `-42`.

Underscores (`_`) are allowed between digits for readability,
but they're ignored and therefore don't affect the value of the literal.
Integer literals can begin with leading zeros (`0`),
but they're likewise ignored and don't affect the base or value of the literal.

Unless otherwise specified,
the default inferred type of an integer literal is the Swift standard library type `Int`.
The Swift standard library also defines types for various sizes of
signed and unsigned integers,
as described in <doc:TheBasics#Integers>.

@Comment {
  TR: The prose assumes underscores only belong between digits.
  Is there a reason to allow them at the end of a literal?
  Java and Ruby both require underscores to be between digits.
  Also, are adjacent underscores meant to be allowed, like 5__000?
  (REPL supports them as of swift-1.21 but it seems odd.)
}

@Comment {
  NOTE: Updated the syntax-grammar to reflect [Contributor 7746]'s comment in
  <rdar://problem/15181997> Teach the compiler about a concept of negative integer literals.
  This feels very strange from a grammatical point of view.
  Update: This is a parser hack, not a lexer hack. Therefore,
  it's not part of the grammar for integer literal, contrary to [Contributor 2562]'s claim.
  (Doug confirmed this, 4/2/2014.)

```


### Floating-Point Literals

*Floating-point literals* represent floating-point values of unspecified precision.

By default, floating-point literals are expressed in decimal (with no prefix),
but they can also be expressed in hexadecimal (with a `0x` prefix).

Decimal floating-point literals consist of a sequence of decimal digits
followed by either a decimal fraction, a decimal exponent, or both.
The decimal fraction consists of a decimal point (`.`)
followed by a sequence of decimal digits.
The exponent consists of an upper- or lowercase `e` prefix
followed by a sequence of decimal digits that indicates
what power of 10 the value preceding the `e` is multiplied by.
For example, `1.25e2` represents 1.25 x 10²,
which evaluates to `125.0`.
Similarly, `1.25e-2` represents 1.25 x 10⁻²,
which evaluates to `0.0125`.

Hexadecimal floating-point literals consist of a `0x` prefix,
followed by an optional hexadecimal fraction,
followed by a hexadecimal exponent.
The hexadecimal fraction consists of a decimal point
followed by a sequence of hexadecimal digits.
The exponent consists of an upper- or lowercase `p` prefix
followed by a sequence of decimal digits that indicates
what power of 2 the value preceding the `p` is multiplied by.
For example, `0xFp2` represents 15 x 2²,
which evaluates to `60`.
Similarly, `0xFp-2` represents 15 x 2⁻²,
which evaluates to `3.75`.

Negative floating-point literals are expressed by prepending a minus sign (`-`)
to a floating-point literal, as in `-42.5`.

Underscores (`_`) are allowed between digits for readability,
but they're ignored and therefore don't affect the value of the literal.
Floating-point literals can begin with leading zeros (`0`),
but they're likewise ignored and don't affect the base or value of the literal.

Unless otherwise specified,
the default inferred type of a floating-point literal is the Swift standard library type `Double`,
which represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
The Swift standard library also defines a `Float` type,
which represents a 32-bit floating-point number.

```


### String Literals

A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks.
A single-line string literal is surrounded by double quotation marks
and has the following form:

```
"<#characters#>"
```


String literals can't contain
an unescaped double quotation mark (`"`),
an unescaped backslash (`\`),
a carriage return, or a line feed.

A multiline string literal is surrounded by three double quotation marks
and has the following form:

```
"""
<#characters#>
"""
```


Unlike a single-line string literal,
a multiline string literal can contain
unescaped double quotation marks (`"`), carriage returns, and line feeds.
It can't contain three unescaped double quotation marks next to each other.

The line break after the `"""`
that begins the multiline string literal
isn't part of the string.
The line break before the `"""`
that ends the literal is also not part of the string.
To make a multiline string literal
that begins or ends with a line feed,
write a blank line as its first or last line.

A multiline string literal can be indented
using any combination of spaces and tabs;
this indentation isn't included in the string.
The `"""` that ends the literal
determines the indentation:
Every nonblank line in the literal must begin
with exactly the same indentation
that appears before the closing `"""`;
there's no conversion between tabs and spaces.
You can include additional spaces and tabs after that indentation;
those spaces and tabs appear in the string.

Line breaks in a multiline string literal are
normalized to use the line feed character.
Even if your source file has a mix of carriage returns and line feeds,
all of the line breaks in the string will be the same.

In a multiline string literal,
writing a backslash (`\`) at the end of a line
omits that line break from the string.
Any whitespace between the backslash and the line break
is also omitted.
You can use this syntax
to hard wrap a multiline string literal in your source code,
without changing the value of the resulting string.

Special characters
can be included in string literals
of both the single-line and multiline forms
using the following escape sequences:

- Null character (`\0`)
- Backslash (`\\`)
- Horizontal tab (`\t`)
- Line feed (`\n`)
- Carriage return (`\r`)
- Double quotation mark (`\"`)
- Single quotation mark (`\'`)
- Unicode scalar (`\\u{`*n*`}`),
  where *n* is a hexadecimal number
  that has one to eight digits

@Comment {
  The behavior of \n and \r isn't the same as C.
  We specify exactly what those escapes mean.
  The behavior on C is platform dependent --
  in text mode, \n maps to the platform's line separator
  which could be CR or LF or CRLF.
}

The value of an expression can be inserted into a string literal
by placing the expression in parentheses after a backslash (`\`).
The interpolated expression can contain a string literal,
but can't contain an unescaped backslash,
a carriage return, or a line feed.

For example, all of the following string literals have the same value:

```swift
"1 2 3"
"1 2 \("3")"
"1 2 \(3)"
"1 2 \(1 + 2)"
let x = 3; "1 2 \(x)"
```


@Comment {
  - test: `string-literals`
  
  ```swifttest

  >> let r1 =

  >> assert(r0 == r2)
  >> let r3 =
  -> "1 2 \(1 + 2)"
  >> assert(r0 == r3)
  -> let x = 3; "1 2 \(x)"
  >> assert(r0 == "1 2 \(x)")
  !$ warning: string literal is unused
  !! let x = 3; "1 2 \(x)"
  !!            ^~~~~~~~~~
  ```
}

}

A string delimited by extended delimiters is a sequence of characters
surrounded by quotation marks and a balanced set of one or more number signs (`#`).
A string delimited by extended delimiters has the following forms:

```
#"<#characters#>"#

#"""
<#characters#>
"""#
```


Special characters in a string delimited by extended delimiters
appear in the resulting string as normal characters
rather than as special characters.
You can use extended delimiters to create strings with characters
that would ordinarily have a special effect
such as generating a string interpolation,
starting an escape sequence,
or terminating the string.

The following example shows a string literal
and a string delimited by extended delimiters
that create equivalent string values:

```swift
let string = #"\(x) \ " \u{2603}"#
let escaped = "\\(x) \\ \" \\u{2603}"
print(string)
// Prints "\(x) \ " \u{2603}"
print(string == escaped)
// Prints "true"
```


@Comment {
  - test: `extended-string-delimiters`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> let string = #"\(x) \ " \u{2603}"#
  -> let escaped = "\\(x) \\ \" \\u{2603}"
  -> print(string)
  <- \(x) \ " \u{2603}
  -> print(string == escaped)
  <- true
  ```
}

If you use more than one number sign to form
a string delimited by extended delimiters,
don't place whitespace in between the number signs:

}

Multiline string literals that you create using extended delimiters
have the same indentation requirements as regular multiline string literals.

The default inferred type of a string literal is `String`.
For more information about the `String` type,
see <doc:StringsAndCharacters>
and [String](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string).

String literals that are concatenated by the `+` operator
are concatenated at compile time.
For example, the values of `textA` and `textB`
in the example below are identical ---
no runtime concatenation is performed.

```swift
let textA = "Hello " + "world"
let textB = "Hello world"
```

  -> let textA = "Hello " + "world"
  -> let textB = "Hello world"

  Quoted text resolves to a sequence of escaped characters by way of
  the quoted-text rule which allows repetition; no need to allow
  repetition in the quoted-text/escaped-character rule too.

  Now that single quotes are gone, we don't have a character literal.
  Because we may one bring them back, here's the old grammar for them:
  
  textual-literal --> character-literal | string-literal
  
  character-literal --> ``'`` quoted-character ``'``
  quoted-character --> escaped-character
  quoted-character --> Any Unicode scalar value except ``'``, ``\``, U+000A, or U+000D
}

### Regular Expression Literals

A regular expression literal is a sequence of characters
surrounded by slashes (`/`) with the following form:

```
/<#regular expression#>/
```


Regular expression literals
must not begin with an unescaped tab or space,
and they can't contain
an unescaped slash (`/`),
a carriage return, or a line feed.

Within a regular expression literal,
a backslash is understood as a part of that regular expression,
not just as an escape character like in string literals.
It indicates that the following special character
should be interpreted literally,
or that the following nonspecial character
should be interpreted in a special way.
For example,
`/\(/` matches a single left parenthesis
and `/\d/` matches a single digit.

@Comment {
  OUTLINE
  
  Doc comments on Regex struct don't have more syntax details,
  or a cross reference to where you can learn more.
  We probably need at least some baseline coverage
  of the supported syntax here.
  (Unified dialect/superset of POSIX + PCRE 2 + Oniguruma + .NET)
  
  https://github.com/apple/swift-experimental-string-processing/blob/main/Sources/_StringProcessing/Regex/Core.swift
  
  Regex literals and the DSL take different approaches to captures.
  The literals give you more type safety.
  The DSL lets you access stuff by name.
  
  From SE-0354:
  A regex literal may be used with a prefix operator,
  e.g `let r = ^^/x/` is parsed as `let r = ^^(/x/)`.
  In this case,
  when encountering operator characters containing `/` in an expression position,
  the characters up to the first `/` are split into a prefix operator,
  and regex literal parsing continues as normal.
}

A regular expression literal delimited by extended delimiters
is a sequence of characters surrounded by slashes (`/`)
and a balanced set of one or more number signs (`#`).
A regular expression literal
delimited by extended delimiters has the following forms:

```
#/<#regular expression#>/#

#/
<#regular expression#>
/#
```


A regular expression literal that uses extended delimiters
can begin with an unescaped space or tab,
contain unescaped slashes (`/`),
and span across multiple lines.
For a multiline regular expression literal,
the opening delimiter must be at the end of a line,
and the closing delimiter must be on its own line.
Inside a multiline regular expression literal,
the extended regular expression syntax is enabled by default ---
specifically, whitespace is ignored and comments are allowed.

@Comment {
  TODO As details about the multiline syntax shake out during SE review,
  like indentation and whitespace,
  add them above or spin out a separate paragraph.
}

If you use more than one number sign to form
a regular expression literal delimited by extended delimiters,
don't place whitespace in between the number signs:

```swift
let regex1 = ##/abc/##       // OK
let regex2 = # #/abc/# #     // Error
```


@Comment {
  - test: `extended-regex-delimiters-err`
  
  ```swifttest
  -> let regex1 = ##/abc/##       // OK
  -> let regex2 = # #/abc/# #     // Error
  ```
}

If you need to make an empty regular expression literal,
you must use the extended delimiter syntax.

## Operators

The Swift standard library defines a number of operators for your use,
many of which are discussed in <doc:BasicOperators>
and <doc:AdvancedOperators>.
The present section describes which characters can be used to define custom operators.

Custom operators can begin with one of the ASCII characters
`/`, `=`, `-`, `+`, `!`, `*`, `%`, `<`, `>`,
`&`, `|`, `^`, `?`, or `~`, or one of the Unicode characters
defined in the grammar below
(which include characters from the
*Mathematical Operators*, *Miscellaneous Symbols*, and *Dingbats*
Unicode blocks, among others).
After the first character,
combining Unicode characters are also allowed.

You can also define custom operators
that begin with a dot (`.`).
These operators can contain additional dots.
For example, `.+.` is treated as a single operator.
If an operator doesn't begin with a dot,
it can't contain a dot elsewhere.
For example, `+.+` is treated as
the `+` operator followed by the `.+` operator.

@Comment {
  - test: `dot-operator-must-start-with-dot`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> infix operator +.+ ;
  !$ error: consecutive statements on a line must be separated by ';'
  !! infix operator +.+ ;
  !!                 ^
  !!                 ;
  !$ error: operator with postfix spacing cannot start a subexpression
  !! infix operator +.+ ;
  !!                 ^
  !$ error: expected expression
  !! infix operator +.+ ;
  !!                    ^
  >> infix operator .+
  >> infix operator .+.
  ```
}

Although you can define custom operators that contain a question mark (`?`),
they can't consist of a single question mark character only.
Additionally, although operators can contain an exclamation point (`!`),
postfix operators can't begin with either a question mark or an exclamation point.

@Comment {
  - test: `postfix-operators-dont-need-unique-prefix`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> struct Num { var value: Int }
     postfix operator +
     postfix operator +*
     postfix func + (x: Num) -> Int { return x.value + 1 }
     postfix func +* (x: Num) -> Int { return x.value * 100 }
  >> let n = Num(value: 5)
  >> print(n+)
  << 6
  >> print(n+*)
  << 500
  ```
}

@Comment {
  - test: `postfix-operator-cant-start-with-question-mark`
  
  ```swifttest
  >> postfix operator ?+
  >> postfix func ?+ (x: Int) -> Int {
         if x > 10 {
             return x
         }
         return x + 1
     }
  >> print(1?+)
  !$ error: postfix operator names starting with '?' or '!' are disallowed to avoid collisions with built-in unwrapping operators
  !! postfix operator ?+
  !!                  ^
  !$ error: '+' is not a postfix unary operator
  !! print(1?+)
  !!         ^
  ```
}

The whitespace around an operator is used to determine
whether an operator is used as a prefix operator, a postfix operator,
or an infix operator. This behavior has the following rules:

- If an operator has whitespace around both sides or around neither side,
  it's treated as an infix operator.
  As an example, the `+++` operator in `a+++b` and `a +++ b` is treated as an infix operator.
- If an operator has whitespace on the left side only,
  it's treated as a prefix unary operator.
  As an example, the `+++` operator in `a +++b` is treated as a prefix unary operator.
- If an operator has whitespace on the right side only,
  it's treated as a postfix unary operator.
  As an example, the `+++` operator in `a+++ b` is treated as a postfix unary operator.
- If an operator has no whitespace on the left but is followed immediately by a dot (`.`),
  it's treated as a postfix unary operator.
  As an example, the  `+++` operator in `a+++.b` is treated as a postfix unary operator
  (`a+++ .b` rather than `a +++ .b`).

For the purposes of these rules,
the characters `(`, `[`, and `{` before an operator,
the characters `)`, `]`, and `}` after an operator,
and the characters `,`, `;`, and `:`
are also considered whitespace.

If the `!` or `?` predefined operator has no whitespace on the left,
it's treated as a postfix operator,
regardless of whether it has whitespace on the right.
To use the `?` as the optional-chaining operator,
it must not have whitespace on the left.
To use it in the ternary conditional (`?` `:`) operator,
it must have whitespace around both sides.

If one of the arguments to an infix operator is a regular expression literal,
then the operator must have whitespace around both sides.

In certain constructs, operators with a leading `<` or `>`
may be split into two or more tokens. The remainder is treated the same way
and may be split again.
As a result, you don't need to add whitespace
to disambiguate between the closing `>` characters in constructs like
`Dictionary<String, Array<Int>>`.
In this example, the closing `>` characters aren't treated as a single token
that may then be misinterpreted as a bit shift `>>` operator.

@Comment {
  NOTE: Once the parser sees a < it goes into a pre-scanning lookahead mode.  It
  matches < and > and looks at what token comes after the > -- if it's a . or
  a ( it treats the <...> as a generic parameter list, otherwise it treats
  them as less than and greater than.
  
  This fails to parse things like x<<2>>(1+2) but it's the same as C#.  So
  don't write that.
  
  We call out the > > vs >> because
  C++ typically needs whitespace to resolve the ambiguity.

@Comment {
  NOTE: The ? is a reserved punctuation.  Optional-chaining (foo?.bar) is actually a
  monad -- the ? is actually a monadic bind operator.  It is like a burrito.
  The current list of reserved punctuation is in Tokens.def.
