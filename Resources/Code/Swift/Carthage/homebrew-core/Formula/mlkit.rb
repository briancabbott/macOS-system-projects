    # The ENV.permit_arch_flags specification is needed on 64-bit
    # machines because the mlkit compiler generates 32-bit machine
    # code whereas the mlton compiler generates 64-bit machine
    # code. Because of this difference, the ENV.m64 and ENV.m32 flags
    # are not sufficient for the formula as clang is used by both
    # tools in a single makefile target. For the mlton-compilation of
    # sml-code, no arch flags are used for the clang assembler
    # invocation. Thus, on a 32-bit machine, both the mlton-compiled
    # binary (the mlkit compiler) and the 32-bit native code generated
    # by the mlkit compiler will be running 32-bit code.
