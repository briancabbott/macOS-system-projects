# API Documentation

Teach developers your Swift APIs through reference documentation you create from comments in source code and documentation extension files.

## Overview

Use documentation markup, a custom variant of Markdown, to add in-source documentation to your APIs. Then, use DocC to build your documentation and share it with developers.
