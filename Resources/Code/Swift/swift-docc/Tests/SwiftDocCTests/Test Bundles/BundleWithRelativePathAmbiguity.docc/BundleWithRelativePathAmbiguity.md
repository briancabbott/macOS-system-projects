# ``BundleWithRelativePathAmbiguity``

This bundle contains external symbols of the dependency module and local extensions to external symbols where some cannot be referenced unambigously.

## Overview

This bundle tests path resolution in a combined documentation archive of the module ``BundleWithRelativePathAmbiguity`` and its `Dependency`. The main bundle ``BundleWithRelativePathAmbiguity`` extends its `Dependency`, thus many of the types from `Dependency` have Extended Type Pages in ``BundleWithRelativePathAmbiguity/Dependency``.
