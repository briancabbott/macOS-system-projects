# Swift-DocC-Render-Artifact

This repository holds a pre-built copy of the [Swift-DocC-Render](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-render)
project auto-generated by the Swift.org CI system. Swift-DocC-Render is a web Single Page Application (SPA)
powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for rendering [Swift-DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc)
documentation.

The files here are available to developers interested in using the latest version
of Swift-DocC-Render with Swift-DocC.

[Swift-DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc) is a tool for building and previewing documentation, 
aimed at making it easy to generate reference documentation from frameworks and packages, 
as well as free-form articles and tutorials authored in Markdown. Please see the 
[Swift-DocC contribution guide](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
