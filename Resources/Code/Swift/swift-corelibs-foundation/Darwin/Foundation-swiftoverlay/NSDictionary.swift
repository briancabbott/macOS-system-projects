  /***
  Precondition: `buffer` points to a region of memory bound to `AnyObject`,
    with a capacity large enough to fit at least `index`+1 elements of type `T`
  
  _bridgeInitialize rebinds the `index`th `T` of `buffer` to `T`,
    and initializes it to `value`

  Note: *not* the `index`th element of `buffer`, since T and AnyObject may be
  different sizes. e.g. if T is String (2 words) then given a buffer like so:

  [object:AnyObject, object:AnyObject, uninitialized, uninitialized]

  `_bridgeInitialize(1, of: buffer, to: buffer[1] as! T)` will leave it as:

  [object:AnyObject, object:AnyObject, string:String]

  and `_bridgeInitialize(0, of: buffer, to: buffer[0] as! T)` will then leave:

  [string:String, string:String]

  Doing this in reverse order as shown above is required if T and AnyObject are
  different sizes. Here's what we get if instead of 1, 0 we did 0, 1:

  [object:AnyObject, object:AnyObject, uninitialized, uninitialized]
  [string:String, uninitialized, uninitialized]
  <segfault trying to treat the second word of 'string' as an AnyObject>

  Note: if you have retained any of the objects in `buffer`, you must release
  them separately, _bridgeInitialize will overwrite them without releasing them
