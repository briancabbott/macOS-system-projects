## Contributing to the status page
The [status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) shows community activity related to the Swift Evolution Process. Changes to it should focus on supporting the efforts of the community in that process.

Before making a pull request to change the status page, consider the following steps:
                
- **Socialize the idea**: Is there a broader desire in the Swift community for the feature? Ask. Ensure that the feature can be implemented using data from the Swift project itself, rather than depending externally derived data.
  
- **Develop a working copy**: Ideas are easiest to understand with a complete implementation. A quick prototype may be good enough for early stage feedback. Once the idea is understood, clean up the code, test it, and format it according to [JavaScript Standard](http://standardjs.com) style.
  
- **Request a review**: Initiate a pull request to the [swift-evolution repository](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution) when a proposed change has a complete implementation. Include a link to a working copy, then assign the review to @krilnon. When everything looks good, the pull request will be merged.
