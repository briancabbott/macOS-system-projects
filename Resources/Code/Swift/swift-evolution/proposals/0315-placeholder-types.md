# Type placeholders (formerly, "Placeholder types")

* Proposal: [SE-0315](0315-placeholder-types.md)
* Authors: [Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://github.com/jumhyn)
* Review Manager: [Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter)
* Status: **Implemented (Swift 5.6)**
* Implementation: [apple/swift#36740](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/36740)
* Decision Notes: [Rationale](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0315-placeholder-types/50671)

Note: this feature was originally discussed and accepted under the "placeholder types" title. The official terminology for this feature is "type placeholders," so the terminology in this proposal has been updated accordingly.

## Introduction

When Swift's type inference is unable to work out the type of a particular expression, it requires the programmer to provide the necessary type context explicitly. However, all mechanisms for doing this require the user to write out the entire type signature, even if only one portion of that type is actually needed by the compiler. E.g.,

```swift
let losslessStringConverter = Double.init as (String) -> Double?

losslessStringConverter("42") //-> 42.0
losslessStringConverter("##") //-> nil
```

In the above example, we only really need to clarify the *argument* type—there's only one `Double.init` overload that accepts a `String`. This proposal allows the user to provide type hints which use *type placeholders* in such circumstances, so that the initialization of `stringTransform` could be written as:

```swift
let losslessStringConverter = Double.init as (String) -> _?
```

Swift-evolution threads: [Partial type annotations ](https://forums.swift.org/t/partial-type-annotations/41239), [Placeholder types](https://forums.swift.org/t/placeholder-types/41329)

## Motivation

Swift's type inference system is quite powerful, but there are many situations where it is impossible (or simply infeasible) for the compiler to work out the type of an expression, or where the user needs to override the default types worked out by the compiler. Directly referencing the heavily-overloaded `Double.init` initializer, as seen above, is one such situation where the compiler does not have the necessary context to determine the type of the expression without additional context.

Fortunately, Swift provides several ways for the user to provide type information explicitly. Common forms are:

* Variable type annotations:

```swift
let losslessStringConverter: (String) -> Double? = Double.init
```

* Type coercion via `as` (seen above):

```swift
let losslessStringConverter = Double.init as (String) -> Double?
```

* Passing type parameters explicitly (e.g., `JSONDecoder` ):

```swift
let dict = try JSONDecoder().decode([String: Int].self, from: data)
```

The downside of all of these approaches is that they require the user to write out the *entire* type, even when the compiler only needs guidance on some sub-component of that type. This can become particularly problematic in cases where a complex type that would normally be inferred has to be written out explicitly because some *unrelated* portion of the type signature is required. E.g.,

```swift
enum Either<Left, Right> {
  case left(Left)
  case right(Right)

  init(left: Left) { self = .left(left) }
  init(right: Right) { self = .right(right) }
}

func makePublisher() -> Some<Complex<Nested<Publisher<Chain<Int>>>>> { ... }
```

Attempting to initialize an `Either` from `makePublisher` isn't as easy as one might like:

```swift
let publisherOrValue = Either(left: makePublisher()) // Error: generic parameter 'Right' could not be inferred
```

Instead, we have to write out the full generic type:

```swift
let publisherOrValue = Either<Some<Complex<Nested<Publisher<Chain<Int>>>>>, Int>(left: makePublisher())
```

The resulting expression is more difficult to write *and* read. If `Left` were the result of a long chain of Combine operators, the author may not even know the correct type to write and would have to glean it from several pages of documentation or compiler error messages.

## Proposed solution

Allow users to write types with designated *type placeholders* (spelled " `_` ") which indicate that the corresponding type should be filled in during type checking. For the above `publisherOrValue` example, this would look like:

```swift
let publisherOrValue = Either<_, Int>(left: makePublisher())
```

Because the generic argument to the `Left` parameter can be inferred from the return type of `makePublisher` , we do not need to write it out. Instead, during type checking, the compiler will see that the first generic argument to `Either` is a placeholder and leave it unresolved until other type information can be used to fill it in.

## Detailed design

### Grammar

This proposal introduces the concept of a user-specified "type placeholder," which, in terms of the grammar, can be written anywhere a type can be written. In particular, the following productions will be introduced:

```swift
type → placeholder-type
placeholder-type → '_'
```

Examples of types containing placeholders are:

```swift
Array<_> // array with placeholder element type
[Int: _] // dictionary with placeholder value type
(_) -> Int // function type accepting a single type placeholder argument and returning 'Int'
(_, Double) // tuple type of placeholder and 'Double'
_? // optional wrapping a type placeholder
```

### Type inference

When the type checker encounters a type containing a type placeholder, it will fill in all of the non-placeholder context exactly as before. Type placeholders will be treated as providing no context for that portion of the type, requiring the rest of the expression to be solvable given the partial context. Effectively, type placeholders act as user-specified anonymous type variables that the type checker will attempt to solve using other contextual information.

Let's examine a concrete example:

```swift
import Combine

func makeValue() -> String { "" }
func makeValue() -> Int { 0 }

let publisher = Just(makeValue()).setFailureType(to: Error.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
```

As written, this code is invalid. The compiler complains about the "ambiguous use of `makeValue()` " because it is unable to determine which `makeValue` overload should be called. We could solve this by providing a full type annotation:

```swift
let publisher: AnyPublisher<Int, Error> = Just(makeValue()).setFailureType(to: Error.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
```

Really, though, this is overkill. The generic argument to `AnyPublisher` 's `Failure` parameter is clearly `Error` , since the result of `setFailureType(to:)` has no ambiguity. Thus, we can substitute in a type placeholder for the `Failure` parameter, and still successfully typecheck this expression:

```swift
let publisher: AnyPublisher<Int, _> = Just(makeValue()).setFailureType(to: Error.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
```

Now, the type checker has all the information it needs to resolve the reference to `makeValue` : the ultimately resulting `AnyPublisher` must have `Output == Int` , so the result of `setFailureType(to:)` must have `Output == Int` , so the instance of `Just` must have `Output == Int` , so the argument to `Just.init` must have type `Int` , so `makeValue` must refer to the `Int` -returning overload!

Note: it is not permitted to specify a type that is _just_ a placeholder—see the relevant subsection in **Future directions** for a discussion of the considerations. This means that, for example, the following would fail to compile:

```swift
let percent: _ = 100.0 // error: placeholders are not allowed as top-level types
```

### Generic constraints

In some cases, placeholders may be expected to conform to certain protocols. E.g., it is perfectly legal to write:

```swift
let dict: [_: String] = [0: "zero", 1: "one", 2: "two"]
```

When examining the storage type for `dict` , the compiler will expect the key type placeholder to conform to `Hashable` . Conservatively, type placeholders are assumed to satisfy all necessary constraints, deferring the verification of these constraints until the checking of the initialization expression.

### Generic parameter inference

A limited version of this feature is already present in the language via generic parameter inference. When the generic arguments to a generic type can be inferred from context, you are permitted to omit them, like so:

```swift
import Combine

let publisher = Just(0) // Just<Int> is inferred!
```

With type placeholders, writing the bare name of a generic type (in most cases, see note below) becomes equivalent to writing the generic signature with type placeholders for the generic arguments. E.g., the initialization of `publisher` above is the same as:

```swift
let publisher = Just<_>(0)
```

Note: there is an existing rule that *inside the body* of a generic type `S<T1, ..., Tn>` , the bare name `S` is equivalent to `S<T1, ..., Tn>` . This proposal does not augment this rule nor attempt to express this rule in terms of type placeholders.

### Function signatures

As is the case today, function signatures under this proposal are required to have their argument and return types fully specified. Generic parameters cannot be inferred and type placeholders are not permitted to appear within the signature, even if the type could ostensibly be inferred from e.g., a protocol requirement or default argument expression.

Thus, it is an error under this proposal to write something like:

```swift
func doSomething(_ count: _? = 0) { ... }
```

just as it would be an error to write:

```swift
func doSomething(_ count: Optional = 0) { ... }
```

even though the type checker could infer the `Wrapped` type in an expression like:

```swift
let count: _? = 0
```

As a more comprehensive example, consider the following setup:

```swift
struct Bar<T, U>
where T: ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral, U: ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral {
    var t: T
    var u: U
}

extension Bar {
    func frobnicate() -> Bar {
        return Bar(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate2() -> Bar<_, _> { // error
        return Bar(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate3() -> Bar {
        return Bar<_, _>(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate4() -> Bar<_, _> { // error
        return Bar<_, _>(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate5() -> Bar<_, U> { // error
        return Bar(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate6() -> Bar {
        return Bar<_, U>(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate7() -> Bar<_, _> { // error
        return Bar<_, U>(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
    func frobnicate8() -> Bar<_, U> { // error
        return Bar<_, _>(t: 42, u: 42)
    }
}
```

Under this proposal, only `frobnicate`, `frobnicate3` and `frobnicate6` would compile without error (`frobnicate`, of course, compiles without this proposal as well), since all others have placeholders appearing in at least one position in the function signature.

### Dynamic casts

In dynamic casts, unlike `as` coercions, there is no inherent relationship between the casted expression and the cast type. This is why we can write things like `0 as? String` or `[""] is Double` (albeit, with warnings that the casts will always fail).

While this proposal does not *explicitly* disallow type placeholders in `is`, `as?`, and `as!` casts, it provides for no additional inference rules for matching the type of the casted expression to the cast type, meaning that in most cases type placeholders will fail to type check if used in these positions (e.g., `0 as? [_]`).

This also applies to `is` and `as` patterns (e.g., `case let y as [_]`).

## Source compatibility

This is an additive change with no effect on source compatibility. Certain invalid code which previously produced errors like "'_' can only appear in a pattern or on the left side of an assignment" may now produce errors which complain about type placeholders.

## Effect on ABI stability

This feature does not have any effect on the ABI.

## Effect on API resilience

Type placeholders are not exposed as API. In a compiled interface, type placeholders (except for those within the bodies of `@inlinable` functions or default argument expressions) are replaced by whatever type the type checker fills in for the type placeholder. While the introduction or removal of a type placeholder *on its own* is not necessarily an API or ABI break, authors should be careful that the introduction/removal of the additional type context does not ultimately change the inferred type of the variable.

## Alternatives considered

### Alternative spellings

Several potential spellings of the type placeholder were suggested, with most users preferring either " `_` " or " `?` ". The question mark version was rejected primarily for the fact that the existing usage of `?` in the type grammar for optionals would be confusing and or ambiguous if it were overloaded to also stand for a type placeholder.

Some users also worried that the underscore spelling would preclude the same spelling from being used for automatically type-erased containers, e.g.,

```swift
var anyArray: Array<_> = [0]
anyArray = ["string"]
let stringArray = anyArray as? Array<String>
```

This objection to the `_` is compelling, but it was noted during discussion that usage of an explicit existential marker keyword (a la `any Array<_>` ) could allow the usage of an underscore for both type placeholders and erased types.

At the pitch phase, the author remains open to alternative spellings for this feature. In particular, the " `any Array<_>` " resolution does not address circumstances where an author may want to both erase some components of a type but allow inference to fill in others.

## Future directions

### Placeholders for generic bases and nested types

In some examples, we're still technically providing more information than the compiler strictly needs to determine the type of an expression. E.g., in the example from the **Type inference** section, we could have conceivably written the type annotation as:

```swift
let publisher: _<Int, _> = Just(makeValue()).setFailureType(to: Error.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
```

Since the type of the generic `AnyPublisher` base is fully determined from the result type of `eraseToAnyPublisher()` .

Similarly, type placeholders could be used in type member positions to denote some type that is nested within another:

```swift
struct S {
  struct Inner {}

  func overloaded() -> Inner {  }
  func overloaded() -> Int {  }
}

func test(val: S) {
  let result: S._ = val.overloaded() // Calls 'func overloaded() -> Inner'
}
```

The author is skeptical that either of these extensions of type placeholders ultimately results in clearer code, and so opts to defer consideration of such a feature until there is further discussion about potential uses/tradeoffs.

### Attributed type placeholders

Type placeholders could be used to apply an attribute when the rest of the type can be inferred from context, e.g.:

```swift
let x: @convention(c) _ = { 0 }
```

Unfortunately, the current model for type attributes makes this somewhat problematic. Type attributes are closely tied to the syntactic form of type names, meaning that constructions like:

```swift
typealias F = () -> Int
let x: @convention(c) F = { 0 }
```

are already illegal.

Since there is more subtle design work to be done here, and because the use cases for this extension of type placeholders are comparatively narrow, the author opts to leave this as a future direction.

### Top-level type placeholders

An earlier draft of this proposal allowed for the use of placeholders as top-level types, so that one could write

```swift
let x: _ = 0.0 // type of x is inferred as Double
```

Compared to other uses of this feature, top-level placeholders are clearly of more limited utility. In type annotations (as above), they merely serve as a slightly more explicit way to indicate "this type is inferred," and they are similarly unhelpful in `as` casts. There is *some* use for top-level placeholders in type expression position, particularly when passing a metatype value as a parameter. For instance, Combine's `setFailureType(to:)` operator could be used with a top-level placeholder to make conversions between failure types more lightweight when necessary:

```swift
let p: AnyPublisher<Int, Error> = Just<Int>().setFailureType(to: _.self).eraseToAnyPublisher()
```

However, as Xiaodi Wu points out, allowing placeholders in these positions would have the effect of permitting clients to leave out type names in circumstances where library authors intended the type information to be provided explicitly, such as when using `KeyedDecodingContainer.decode(_:forKey:)`. It is not obviously desirable for users to be able to write, e.g.:

```swift
self.someProp = try container.decode(_.self, forKey: .someProp)
```

Due to the additional considerations here, the author has opted to leave top-level placeholders as a future direction, which could potentially be considered once there is more real-world usage of type placeholders that could inform the benefits and drawbacks.
