# Unicode

This fixture makes extensive use of exotic Unicode. While deliberately trying to break a as many common false assumptions as possible, *this is a valid package*, and clients are encouraged to test their functionality with it. A tool that successfully handles this package is unlikely to encounter problems with any real‐world package in any human language.

The neighbouring package `UnicodeDependency‐πשּׁµ𝄞🇺🇳🇮🇱x̱̱̱̱̱̄̄̄̄̄` must be placed next this package and tagged with version 1.0.0. (This is necessary to use Unicode in dependency URLs in this package’s manifest.)
