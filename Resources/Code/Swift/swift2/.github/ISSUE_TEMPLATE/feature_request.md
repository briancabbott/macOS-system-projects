<!--
This repository tracks issues and requests related to the implementation of the
Swift compiler, standard library, runtime, and tools that provide IDE support
for Swift (e.g. code completion). If your feature request relates to the
implementation of a proprietary (closed-source) Apple framework such as UIKit,
SwiftUI, Combine, etc., please report it to https://feedbackassistant.apple.com
instead.

If you haven't found or started a thread on the Swift forums yet, consider
socializing your idea in the "Discussion" subcategory
(https://forums.swift.org/c/evolution/discuss) after submitting this request.
This is an essential step toward the official review of any proposal concerning
language or library design, and while GitHub issues do great for tracking
purposes, the forums are far better ground for drawing attention to ideas and
gauging interest from the community.

For more information on how ideas are proposed, discussed, and reviewed, see
https://swift.org/swift-evolution
