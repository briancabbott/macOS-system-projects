// This file provides utilities for SSA def-use and use-def walking.
// There are four walker protocols:
// * for both directions: down (= def-use) and up (= use-def)
// * for values and addresses
// ```
//   protocol ValueDefUseWalker
//   protocol AddressDefUseWalker
//   protocol ValueUseDefWalker
//   protocol AddressUseDefWalker
// ```
//
// To use a walker, just conform to one (or multiple) of those protocols.
// There are several ways to configure the walker by providing implementations of
// their protocol functions. For details see the protocol definitions.
// The value-walkers also require to provide a "cache" property - see `WalkerCache`.
//
// The walkers maintain a "path" during the walk, which in it's simplest form can
// just be a SmallProjectionPath. For details see `WalkingPath`.

///     path is `s0.s1` then the target value is reachable from `%res` with path `s1`.
///     If the path doesn't match `unmatchedPath` is called.

/// ```
