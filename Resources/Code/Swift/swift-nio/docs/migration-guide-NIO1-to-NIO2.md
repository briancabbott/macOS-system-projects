# NIO 1 to NIO 2 migration guide

Please take a look at the [migration guide included with SwiftNIO 2.29.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/blob/2.29.0/docs/migration-guide-NIO1-to-NIO2.md), the last version with Swift 5.0 support. 

[SwiftNIO 2.29.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/2.29.0) includes the `_NIO1APIShims` module which can help to ease the migration.
