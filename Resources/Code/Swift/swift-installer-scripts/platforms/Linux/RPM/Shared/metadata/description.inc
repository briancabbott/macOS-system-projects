Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using
a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design
patterns.

The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available
language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile
and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services. Most
importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining
correct programs easier for the developer.
