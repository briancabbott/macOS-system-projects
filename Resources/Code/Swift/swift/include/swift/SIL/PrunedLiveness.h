/// Incrementally compute and represent basic block liveness of a single live
/// range. The live range is defined by points in the CFG, independent of any
/// particular SSA value; however, it must be contiguous. Unlike traditional
/// variable liveness, a definition within the live range does not create a
/// "hole" in the live range. The client initializes liveness with a set of
/// definition blocks, typically a single block. The client then incrementally
/// updates liveness by providing a set of "interesting" uses one at a time.
///
/// This supports discovery of pruned liveness during control flow traversal. It
/// is not tied to a single SSA value and allows the client to select
/// interesting uses while ignoring other uses.
///
/// The PrunedLiveBlocks result maps each block to its current liveness state:
/// Dead, LiveWithin, LiveOut.
///
/// A LiveWithin block has a liveness boundary within the block. The client can
/// determine the boundary's instruction position by searching for the last use.
///
/// LiveOut indicates that liveness extends into a successor edges, therefore,
/// no uses within that block can be on the liveness boundary, unless that use
/// occurs before a def in the same block.
///
/// All blocks are initially assumed Dead. Initializing a definition block marks
/// that block LiveWithin. Each time an interesting use is discovered, blocks
/// liveness may undergo one of these transitions:
///
/// - Dead -> LiveWithin
/// - Dead -> LiveOut
/// - LiveWithin -> LiveOut
///
/// Example 1. Local liveness.
///
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
/// | Use |
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Example 2. Cross-block liveness.
///
/// Initial State after initializing a def block:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Use | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Later state after updateForUse is applied to the use:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveOut]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [LiveOut]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Use | [LiveWithin]
///  -----
///
///
/// An invariant is that for any liveness region, the post-dominating blocks of
/// the region are the LiveWithin regions.

/// Discover "pruned" liveness for an arbitrary set of uses. The client builds
/// liveness by first initializing "def" blocks, then incrementally feeding uses
/// to updateForUse().
///
/// For SSA live ranges, a single "def" block will dominate all uses. If no def
/// block is provided, liveness is computed as if defined by a function
/// argument. If the client does not provide a single, dominating def block,
/// then the client must at least ensure that no uses precede the first
/// definition in a def block. Since this analysis does not remember the
/// positions of defs, it assumes that, within a block, uses follow
/// defs. Breaking this assumption will result in a "hole" in the live range in
/// which the def block's predecessors incorrectly remain dead. This situation
/// could be handled by adding an updateForUseBeforeFirstDef() API.
///
/// We allow for multiple bits of liveness information to be tracked by
/// internally using a SmallBitVector. The multiple bit tracking is useful when
/// tracking state for multiple fields of the same root value. To do this, we
/// actually track 2 bits per actual needed bit so we can represent 3 Dead,
/// LiveOut, LiveWithin. This was previously unnecessary since we could just
/// represent dead by not having liveness state for a block. With multiple bits
/// possible this is no longer true.

/// Given a type T and a descendent field F in T's type tree, then the
/// sub-element number of F is the first leaf element of the type tree in its
/// linearized representation.
///
/// Linearized Representation of Structs/Tuples
/// -------------------------------------------
///
/// For structs/tuples, the linearized representation is just an array with one
/// element for each leaf element. Thus if we have a struct of the following
/// sort:
///
/// ```
/// struct Pair {
///   var lhs: Int
///   var rhs: Int
/// }
///
/// struct MyStruct {
///   var firstField: Int
///   var pairField: Pair
///   var tupleField: (Int, Int)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// the linearized representation of MyStruct's type tree leaves would be:
///
/// ```
/// [firstField, pairField.lhs, pairField.rhs, tupleField.0, tupleField.1]
/// ```
///
/// So if one had an uninitialized myStruct and initialized pairField, one would
/// get the following bit set of liveness:
///
/// ```
/// [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
/// ```
///
/// Linearized Representation of Enums
/// ----------------------------------
///
/// Since enums are sum types, an enum can require different numbers of bits in
/// its linearized representation depending on the payload of the case that the
/// enum is initialized to. To work around this problem in our representation,
/// we always store enough bits for the max sized payload of all cases of the
/// enum and add an additional last bit for the discriminator. Any extra bits
/// that may be needed (e.x.: we are processing a enum case with a smaller
/// payload) are always assumed to be set to the same value that the
/// discriminator bit is set to. This representation allows us to track liveness
/// trading off the ability to determine information about the actual case that
/// we are tracking. Since we just care about liveness, this is a trade off that
/// we are willing to make since our goal (computing liveness) is still solved.
///
/// With the above paragraph in mind, an example of the bit layout of an enum
/// looks as follows:
///
/// ```
/// [ PAYLOAD BITS | EXTRA_TOP_LEVEL_BITS | DISCRIMINATOR_BIT ]
/// ```
///
/// Notice how placing the discriminator bit last ensures that separately the
/// payload and the extra top level bits/discriminator bit are both contiguous
/// in the representation. This ensures that we can test both that the payload
/// is live and separately that the discriminator/extra top level bits are live
/// with a single contiguous range of bits. This is important since field
/// sensitive liveness can only compute liveness for contiguous ranges of bits.
///
/// Lets look at some examples, starting with E:
///
/// ```
/// enum E {
/// case firstCase
/// case secondCase(Int)
/// case thirdCase(Pair)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The linearized representation of E would be three slots since the payload
/// with the largest linearized representation is Pair:
///
///            ----- |E| --------
///           /                  \
///          /                    \
///         v                      v

/// would not update the bit for the enum case itself and any additional spare

/// impossible to dynamically change the payload of an enum without destroying
/// the original enum and its payload since that would be a verifier caught
