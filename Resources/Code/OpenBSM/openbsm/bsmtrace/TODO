TODO for bsmtrace

(1) Add more enhanced logging.
(2) Add support for triggers during state transition.
(3) Add the ability to assign priorities to defined sequences.
(4) Add the notion of "scope". Currently, all events are tied
    to a specific subject, instead of process or process group.
(5) Add detection/notification of processes core dumping/segfaulting.
