DPE
===

DPE Default Password Enumeration Concept as an effort to provide structured enumeration of default logons and passwords of network devices, applications and Operating Systems.
The main goal is to increase the “password auditing scanners” interoperability potential. Any kind of tool integrating the XML DPE scheme will be able to identify and report default access configurations on specific devices, software or operating systems.
Taking into account the benefits of SecurityMetrics standards principles, DPE integrates CPE naming scheme (http://cpe.mitre.org) to describe information technology systems, platforms and packages and CVE (http://cve.mitre.org) to describe the vulnerability
