# OpticSpy

### Description
Data exfiltration from a compromised device is usually achieved over the network, via hardware implant, or by manipulating the characteristics of an internal electronic component. Optical covert channels transmit data by modulating visible light in a way that is undetectable to the human eye.

OpticSpy consists of two open source hardware modules that provide a low-cost way to explore, evaluate, and experiment with optical covert channels. One is based on an easy-to-build digital receiver, while the other is an analog design that allows fine-tuning for a particular target signal.
