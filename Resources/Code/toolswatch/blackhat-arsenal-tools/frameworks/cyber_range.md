#  Cyber Range:  An AWS-based Open-Source Cyber Range framework

### Description

This CyberRange project represents the first open-source Cyber Range blueprint in the world.

This project provides a bootstrap framework for a complete offensive, defensive, reverse engineering, & security intelligence tooling in a private research lab using the AWS Cloud.

This project contains vulnerable systems and a toolkit of the most powerful open-source / community edition tools known to Penetration testers.

It simply provides a researcher with a disposable offensive / defensive AWS-based environment in less than 5 minutes.
