# Packet Sender

### Description
Packet Sender is a free open-source (GPLv2) cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) tool used daily by security researchers, college students, and professional developers to troubleshoot and reverse engineer network-based devices. Its core features are crafting and listening for UDP, TCP, and SSL/TLS packets via IPv4 or IPv6. It can listen simultaneously on any number of ports while sending to any UDP, TCP, SSL/TLS packet server.

Many deliberate design features help Packet Sender's success: It can send and reply; it supports IPv4, IPv6, general, or IP-specific binding; it can run completely portable (for thumb drives); it can operate entirely in userland; it has very few build dependencies (to be able to support nearly all the Linux distros); and it has a very responsive and easy to use GUI with good defaults and ASCII/HEX translator to immediately send/receive packets within seconds of first launching.

There are many uses for Packet Sender:
* Control devices beyond their original apps
* Developing / Reverse Engineering Network APIs
* Automation (through CLI)
* Malware analysis
* Testing network connectivity/firewalls
* Security Tests (SSL)
* Tech support (portable Packet Sender)
