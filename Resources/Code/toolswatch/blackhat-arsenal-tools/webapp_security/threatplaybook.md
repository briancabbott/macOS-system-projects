# ThreatPlaybook

### Description
A (relatively) Unopinionated framework that faciliates Threat Modeling as Code married with Application Security Automation on a single Fabric. 

ThreatPlaybook was born in we45, as a framework to capture Threat Models for our internal Projects (especially Pentests). We have built it with the following parameters in mind: 
* Threat Models as Code: Codify Threat Models by Capturing User Stories => Abuser Stories => Threat Models/Scenarios and Test Cases in YAML files that can be parsed and processed by another system
* Capture Security Test Cases: Security Test Cases are descriptions of techniques used by security testers to test for specific vulnerabilities. These may include SAST, DAST tools, SCA tools, Reconnaissance tools and so on
* Leverage Security Automation: Inspired the Playbook style models of Ansible, Kubernetes, Metta and so on, we wanted to create framework that could amalgamate Threat Models, Test Cases and running of targeted Security Automation. We have used the Robot Framework to process the Threat Models and run the Security Automation Test Cases
