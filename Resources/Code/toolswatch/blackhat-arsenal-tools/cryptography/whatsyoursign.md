# WhatsYourSign

### Description
Verifying a file's cryptographic signature can deduce its origin or trustability. Unfortunately on OS X there is no simple way to view a file's signature from the UI.

WhatsYourSign adds a menu item to Finder.app. Simply right-, or control-click on any file to display its cryptographic signing information!
