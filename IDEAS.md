### Performance Setup and Monitoring
   - A simple app to go through known performance settings and signals (as far as locations to check for logging or behavioral info indicating perf-issues.)
     - (optionally) make the system updates to establish a superior performance profile.

   - Continuous perf-mon: monitor things like... well, end-user-experience slow-down events as well as application-experience performance events.
     - Produce an event reports list
